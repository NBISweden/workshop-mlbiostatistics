Figure @ref(fig:diff-01) shows a function \\(f(x)\\) with two possible argument values \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) marked and their corresponding function values \\(f(a)\\) and \\(f(b)\\).\nConsider that \\(x\\) is increasing from \\(a\\) to \\(b\\). The change in \\(x\\) is \\(b-a\\), i.e. as \\(x\\) increases from \\(a\\) to \\(b\\) the function \\(f(x)\\) increase from \\(f(a)\\) to \\(f(b)\\). The change in \\(f(x)\\) is \\(f(b)-f(a)\\) and the average rate of change of \\(y\\) across the \\([a,b]\\) interval is:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{change\\:in\\:y}{change\\:in\\:x}=\\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}\n(\\#eq:diff-point)\n\\end{equation}\\]\nE.g. let’s take a quadratic function \\(f(x)=x^2\\) and calculate the average rate of change across the interval \\([1, 4]\\).\n\nThe change in \\(x\\) is \\(4-1\\) and the change in \\(f(x)\\) is \\(f(4) - f(1) = 4^2 -1^2 = 16 - 1 = 15\\).

    "text": "4.3 Rate of change at a point\n\nWe often need to know the rate of change of a function at a point, and not simply an average rate of change across an interval.\nFigure @ref(fig:diff-02), similar to Figure @ref(fig:diff-01), shows, instead of two points \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), point \\(a\\) and a second point defined in terms of its distance from the first point \\(a\\). Thus, the two points are now \\(a\\) and \\(a + h\\) and the distance between the two points is equal to \\(h\\).\nNow we can write that: \\[\\frac{change\\:in\\:y}{change\\:in\\:x}=\\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{a+h-a} = \\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe average rate of change of \\(f(x)\\) with respect to \\(x\\) over \\([a, b]\\) is equal to the slope of the secant line (in black)\n\n\n\n\nFurther:\n\nif we assume that the second point \\(a+h\\) is really close to \\(a\\), meaning that \\(h\\) approaches 0, denoted as \\(h \\rightarrow 0\\), we can find the rate of change at the point \\(a\\)\nthe distance between the two points \\(a\\) and \\(a+h\\) is getting smaller and so is the difference of the function values \\(f(a+h) - f(a)\\). We denote these small differences as \\(\\delta x\\) and \\(\\delta y\\), pronounced “delta x” and “delta y”, respectively.\nthe term \\(\\delta\\) reads as “delta” and represents a small change\n\nWe can thus continue and write that a rate of change of a function at a point is given by \\[\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{small\\:change\\:in\\:y}{small\\:change\\:in\\:x} = \\lim_{h\\to0}\\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}\n(\\#eq:diff-point-2)\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\nE.g. let’s look at the linear function \\(f(x) = 2x+3\\). We can find the rate of change at any point of \\(x\\) by: \\[\\frac{small\\:change\\:in\\:y}{small\\:change\\:in\\:x} = \\\\\\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{x+h-x}= \\lim_{h\\to0}\\frac{2(x+h)+3-(2x+3)}{x+h-x}=\\lim_{h\\to0}\\frac{2h}{h}=2\\] It means that the function value \\(f(x)\\) increases by 2 for every small increase, \\(h\\), in \\(x\\). Here, this increase is the same for all the values of \\(x\\), i.e. it does not depend on \\(x\\). The change in function value \\(f(x)\\) can depend on the value of \\(x\\), for instance if we look at the quadratic \\(f(x)=x^2\\) function, we get: \\[\\frac{small\\:change\\:in\\:y}{small\\:change\\:in\\:x} = \\\\ \\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{x+h-x}=\\lim_{h\\to0}\\frac{x^2+2xh+h^2-x^2}{h}=\\lim_{h\\to0}\\frac{2xh+h^2}{h}=2x+h\\]  This means that:\n\nthe rate of change for the function \\(f(x)\\) at a point \\(x\\) is \\(2x\\)\nthe \\(f(x)\\) value increases by \\(2x\\) for every small increase, \\(h\\), in \\(x\\)\nthe rate of change along a quadratic function is changing constantly according to the value of \\(x\\) we are looking at, it is a function of \\(x\\)\nand finally that the rate of change does not give us any information about the rate of change globally."
