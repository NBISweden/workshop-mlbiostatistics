To be able to use it it is essential to learn symbols and understand how they are used to represent physical quantities as well as understand the rules and conventions that have been developed to manipulate them. variables: things that can vary, e.g. temperature and time constants: fixed and unchanging quantities used in certain calculations, e.g. 3.14159 in principle one could freely choose letters and symbols to represent variables and constants, but it is helpful and choose letters and symbols that have meaning in a particular context. Hence, we \\(x, y, z\\), the end of the alphabet is reserved for variables \\(a, b, c\\), the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent constants \\(\\pi\\), \\(\\omega\\) and Greek letters below are used frequently used to represent common constant, e.g. \\(\\pi = 3.14159\\) Table 1.1: Uppercase and lowercase letters of the Greek alphabet Letter Upper case Lower case Letter Upper case Lower case Alpha A \\(\\alpha\\) Nu N \\(\\nu\\) Beta B \\(\\beta\\) Xi \\(\\Xi\\) \\(\\xi\\) Gamma \\(\\Gamma\\) \\(\\gamma\\) Omicron O o Delta \\(\\Delta\\) \\(\\delta\\) Pi \\(\\Pi\\) \\(\\pi\\) Epsilon E \\(\\epsilon\\) Rho P \\(\\rho\\) Zeta Z \\(\\zeta\\) Sigma \\(\\Sigma\\) \\(\\sigma\\) Eta H \\(\\eta\\) Tau T \\(\\tau\\) Theta \\(\\Theta\\) \\(\\theta\\) Upsilon Y \\(\\upsilon\\) Iota I \\(\\iota\\) Phi \\(\\Phi\\) \\(\\phi\\) Kappa K \\(\\kappa\\) Chi X \\(\\chi\\) Lambda \\(\\Lambda\\) \\(\\lambda\\) Psi \\(\\Psi\\) \\(\\psi\\) Mu M \\(\\mu\\) Omega \\(\\Omega\\) \\(\\omega\\) 1.3 A precise language Mathematics is a precise language meaning that a special attention has to be paid to the exact position of any symbol in relation to other. Given two symbols \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), \\(xy\\) and \\(x^y\\) and \\(x_y\\) can mean different things \\(xy\\) stands for multiplication, \\(x^y\\) for superscript and \\(x_y\\) for subscript 1.4 Using symbols If the letters \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) represent two numbers, then: their sum is written as \\(x + y\\) subtracting \\(y\\) from \\(x\\) is \\(x - y\\), known also as difference to multiply \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) we written as \\(x \\cdot y\\) or also with the multiplication signed omitted as \\(xy\\). The quantity is known as product of x and y multiplication is associative, e.g. when we multiply three numbers together, \\(x \\cdot y \\cdot z\\), the order of multiplication does not matter, so \\(x \\cdot y \\cdot z\\) is the same as \\(z \\cdot x \\cdot y\\) or \\(y \\cdot z \\cdot x\\) division is denoted by \\(\\frac{x}{y}\\) and means that \\(x\\) is divided by \\(y\\). In this expression \\(x\\), on the top, is called numerator and \\(y\\), on the bottom, is called denominator division by 1 leaves any number unchanged, e.g. \\(\\frac{x}{1}=x\\) and division by 0 is not allowed Equal sign the equal sign \\(=\\) is used in equations, e.g. \\(x - 5 = 0\\) or \\(5x = 1\\) the equal sign \\(=\\) can be also used in formulae. Physical quantities are related through a formula in many fields, e.g. the formula \\(A=\\pi r^2\\) relates circle area \\(A\\) to its radius \\(r\\) and the formula \\(s = \\frac{d}{t}\\) defines speed as distance \\(d\\) divided by time \\(t\\) the equal sign \\(=\\) is also used in identities, expressions true for all values of the variable, e.g. \\((x-1)(x-1) = (x^2-1)\\) opposite to the equal sign is “is not equal to” sign \\(\\neq\\), e.g. we can write \\(1+2 \\neq 4\\) Sigma and Product notation the \\(\\Sigma\\) notation, read as Sigma notation, provides a convenient way of writing longs sums, e.g. the sum of \\(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + ... + x_{20}\\) is written as \\(\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^{i=20}x_i\\) the \\(\\Pi\\) notation, read as Product notation, provides a convenient way of writing longs products, e.g. \\(x_1 \\cdot x_2 \\cdot x_3 \\cdot ... \\cdot x_{20}\\) is written as \\(\\displaystyle \\prod_{i=1}^{i=20}x_i\\) 1.5 Inequalities Given any two real numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) there are three mutually exclusive possibilities: \\(a &gt; b\\), meaning that \\(a\\) is greater than \\(b\\) \\(a &lt; b\\), meaning that \\(a\\) is less than \\(b\\) \\(a = b\\), meaning that \\(a\\) is equal to \\(b\\) Strict and weak inequality in \\(a &gt; b\\) and \\(a &lt; b\\) is strict as oppose to weak inequality denoted as \\(a \\ge b\\) or \\(a \\le b\\) Some useful relations are: if \\(a &gt; b\\) and \\(b &gt; c\\) then \\(a &gt; c\\) if \\(a &gt; b\\) then \\(a + c &gt; b\\) for any positive \\(c\\) if \\(a &gt; b\\) then \\(ac &gt; bc\\) for any positive \\(c\\) if \\(a &gt; b\\) then \\(ac &lt; bc\\) for any negative \\(c\\) 1.6 Indices and powers Indices, also known as powers are convenient when we multiply a number by itself several times e.g. \\(5 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 5\\) is written as \\(5^3\\) and \\(4 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 4\\) is written as \\(4^5\\) in the expression \\(x^y\\), \\(x\\) is called the base and \\(y\\) is called index or power The laws of indices state: \\(a^m \\cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\\) \\(\\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}\\) \\((a^m)^n = a^{m\\cdot n}\\) Rules derived from the laws of indices: \\(a^0 = 1\\) \\(a^1 = a\\) Negative and fractional indices: \\(a^{-m} = \\frac{1}{a^m}\\) e.g. \\(5^{-2} = \\frac{1}{5^2} = \\frac{1}{25}\\) for negative indices e.g. \\(4^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\sqrt{4}\\) or \\(8^{\\frac{1}{3}} = \\sqrt[3]{8}\\) for fractional indices 1.7 Exercises: notations Exercise 1.1 Classify numbers as natural, integers or real.

The empty set is a subset of every set. 2.2 Basic set operations union of two sets, \\(\\cup\\) : two sets can be “added” together, the union of A and B, written as \\(A \\cup B\\), e.g. \\(\\{1, 2\\} \\cup \\{2, 3\\} = \\{1, 2, 3\\}\\) or \\(\\{1, 2, 3\\} \\cup \\{1, 4, 5, 6\\} = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\) intersection of two sets, \\(\\cap\\): a new set can be constructed by taking members of two sets that are “in common”, written as \\(A \\cap B\\), e.g. \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\} \\cap \\{2, 3, 7\\} = \\{2, 3\\}\\) or \\(\\{1, 2, 3\\} \\cap \\{7 \\} = \\{\\emptyset \\}\\) complement of a set, \\(A&#39;\\), \\(A^c\\): are the elements not in A difference of two sets, \\(\\setminus\\): two sets can be “substracted”, denoted by \\(A \\setminus B\\), by taking all elements that are members of A but are not members of B, e.g. \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\setminus \\{1, 3\\} = \\{2, 4\\}\\).

Common terms worth knowing: Figure 3.2: Common function terms 3.2 Evaluating function To evaluate a function is to replace (substitute) its variable with a given number or expression. E.g. given a rule (function) that maps temperature measurements from Celsius to Fahrenheit scale: \\[f(x) = 1.8x + 32\\] where \\(x\\) is temperature measurements in Celsius and \\(f(x)\\) is the associated value in Fahrenheit, we can find for a given temperature in Celsius corresponding temperature in Fahrenheit. Let’s say we measure 10 Celsius degrees one autumn day in Uppsala and we want to share this information with a friend in USA. We can find the equivalent temperature in Fahrenheit by evaluating our function at 10, \\(f(10)\\), giving us \\[f(10) = 1.8\\cdot 10 + 32 = 50\\] 3.3 Plotting function Function graphs are a convenient way of showing functions, by looking at the graph it is easier to notice function’s properties, e.g. for which input values functions yields positive outcomes or whether the function is increasing or decreasing. To graph a function, one can start by evaluating function at different values for the argument \\(x\\) obtaining \\(f(x)\\), plotting the points by plotting the pairs \\((x, f(x))\\) and connecting the dots. E.g. evaluating our above temperature rule at -20, -10, 0, 10, 20, 30 Celsius degrees results in: x (Celsius degrees) evaluates f(x) (Farenheit degress) -20 \\(f(-20) = 1.8 \\cdot (-20) + 32\\) -4 -10 \\(f(-10) = 1.8 \\cdot (-10) + 32\\) 14 0 \\(f(0) = 1.8 \\cdot (0) + 32\\) 32 10 \\(f(10) = 1.8 \\cdot (10) + 32\\) 50 20 \\(f(20) = 1.8 \\cdot (20) + 32\\) 68 30 \\(f(30) = 1.8 \\cdot (30) + 32\\) 86 Figure 3.3: Graph of f(x) for the temeprature rule 3.4 Standard classes of functions Algebraic function: functions that can be expressed as the solution of a polynomial equation with integer coefficients, e.g. constant function \\(f(x) = a\\) identity function \\(f(x) = x\\) linear function \\(f(x) = ax + b\\) quadratic function \\(f(x) = a + bx + cx^2\\) cubic function \\(fx() = a + bx + cx^2 + dx^3\\) Transcedental functions: functions that are not algebraic, e.g. exponential function \\(f(x) = e^x\\) logarithimic function \\(f(x) = log(x)\\) trigonometric function \\(f(x) = -3sin(2x)\\) Figure 3.4: Examples of the standard classess of functions 3.5 Piecewise functions A function can be in pieces, i.e. we can create functions that behave differently based on the input \\(x\\) value.

The change in \\(x\\) is \\(b-a\\), i.e. as \\(x\\) increases from \\(a\\) to \\(b\\) the function \\(f(x)\\) increase from \\(f(a)\\) to \\(f(b)\\). The change in \\(f(x)\\) is \\(f(b)-f(a)\\) and the average rate of change of \\(y\\) across the \\([a,b]\\) interval is: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{change\\:in\\:y}{change\\:in\\:x}=\\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} \\tag{4.1} \\end{equation}\\] E.g. let’s take a quadratic function \\(f(x)=x^2\\) and calculate the average rate of change across the interval \\([1, 4]\\). The change in \\(x\\) is \\(4-1\\) and the change in \\(f(x)\\) is \\(f(4) - f(1) = 4^2 -1^2 = 16 - 1 = 15\\). So the average rate of change is \\(\\frac{15}{3}=5\\). What does this mean? It means that across the interval \\([1,4]\\) on average the \\(f(x)\\) value increases by 5 for every 1 unit increase in \\(x\\). If we were to look at the average rate of change across the interval \\([-2, 0]\\) we would get \\(\\frac{f(0)-f(-2)}{0 - (-2)}=\\frac{0 - (-2)^2}{2}=\\frac{-4}{2} = -2\\). Here, over the \\([-2, 0]\\) on average the \\(f(x)\\) value decreases by 2 for every 1 unit increase in \\(x\\). Looking at the graph of \\(f(x)=x^2\\) verifies our calculations Figure 4.3: Example function \\(f(x) = x^2\\) 4.3 Rate of change at a point We often need to know the rate of change of a function at a point, and not simply an average rate of change across an interval. Figure 4.4, similar to Figure 4.2, shows, instead of two points \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), point \\(a\\) and a second point defined in terms of its distance from the first point \\(a\\). Thus, the two points are now \\(a\\) and \\(a + h\\) and the distance between the two points is equal to \\(h\\). Now we can write that: \\[\\frac{change\\:in\\:y}{change\\:in\\:x}=\\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{a+h-a} = \\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}\\] Figure 4.4: The average rate of change of \\(f(x)\\) with respect to \\(x\\) over \\([a, b]\\) is equal to the slope of the secant line (in black) Further: if we assume that the second point \\(a+h\\) is really close to \\(a\\), meaning that \\(h\\) approaches 0, denoted as \\(h \\rightarrow 0\\), we can find the rate of change at the point \\(a\\) the distance between the two points \\(a\\) and \\(a+h\\) is getting smaller and so is the difference of the function values \\(f(a+h) - f(a)\\). We denote these small differences as \\(\\delta x\\) and \\(\\delta y\\), pronounced “delta x” and “delta y”, respectively. the term \\(\\delta\\) reads as “delta” and represents a small change We can thus continue and write that a rate of change of a function at a point is given by \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{small\\:change\\:in\\:y}{small\\:change\\:in\\:x} = \\lim_{h\\to0}\\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} \\tag{4.2} \\end{equation}\\] E.g. let’s look at the linear function \\(f(x) = 2x+3\\). We can find the rate of change at any point of \\(x\\) by: \\[\\frac{small\\:change\\:in\\:y}{small\\:change\\:in\\:x} = \\\\\\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{x+h-x}= \\lim_{h\\to0}\\frac{2(x+h)+3-(2x+3)}{x+h-x}=\\lim_{h\\to0}\\frac{2h}{h}=2\\] It means that the function value \\(f(x)\\) increases by 2 for every small increase, \\(h\\), in \\(x\\). Here, this increase is the same for all the values of \\(x\\), i.e. it does not depend on \\(x\\). The change in function value \\(f(x)\\) can depend on the value of \\(x\\), for instance if we look at the quadratic \\(f(x)=x^2\\) function, we get: \\[\\frac{small\\:change\\:in\\:y}{small\\:change\\:in\\:x} = \\\\ \\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{x+h-x}=\\lim_{h\\to0}\\frac{x^2+2xh+h^2-x^2}{h}=\\lim_{h\\to0}\\frac{2xh+h^2}{h}=2x+h\\] This means that: the rate of change for the function \\(f(x)\\) at a point \\(x\\) is \\(2x\\) the \\(f(x)\\) value increases by \\(2x\\) for every small increase, \\(h\\), in \\(x\\) the rate of change along a quadratic function is changing constantly according to the value of \\(x\\) we are looking at, it is a function of \\(x\\) and finally that the rate of change does not give us any information about the rate of change globally. 4.4 Terminology and notation differentiation is the process of finding the rate of change of a given function the function is said to be differentiated the rate of change of a function is also known as the derivative of the function given a function \\(f(x)\\) we say that we differentiate function in respect to \\(x\\) and write: \\[\\lim_{h\\to0}\\frac{\\delta y}{\\delta x}= \\frac{dy}{dx}\\] or use the “prime” \\[f´(x)\\] 4.5 Table of derivatives in practice, there is no need to compute \\(\\displaystyle \\lim_{h\\to0}\\frac{\\delta y}{\\delta x}\\) every time when we want to find a derivative of a function instead, we can use patterns of the common functions and their derivatives Table 4.1: Common functions and their derivatives, \\(k\\) denotes a constant Function \\(f(x)\\) Derivative \\(f&#39;(x)\\) \\(k\\) \\(0\\) \\(x\\) \\(1\\) \\(kx\\) \\(k\\) \\(x^n\\) \\(nx^{n-1}\\) \\(kx^n\\) \\(knx^{n-1}\\) \\(e^x\\) \\(e^x\\) \\(e^{kx}\\) \\(ke^{kx}\\) \\(\\ln(x)\\) \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\) \\(\\ln(kx)\\) \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\) We can use the Table 4.1 to find derivatives of some of the functions e.g. \\(f(x) = 3x\\), \\(f&#39;(x) = 3\\) \\(f(x) = 2x^4\\), \\(f&#39;(x) = 2*4x^{4-1} = 8x^3\\) \\(f(x) = e^{2x}\\), \\(f&#39;(x) = 2e^{2x}\\) \\(f(x) = \\ln(4x)\\), \\(f&#39;(x) = \\frac{1}{x}\\) 4.6 Exercises: differentiation Exercise 4.1 Find derivatives of the functions \\(f(x) = 2\\) \\(f(x) = 2x + 1\\) \\(f(x) = 5x^2\\) \\(f(x) = 4x^3 + x^2\\) \\(f(x) = \\sqrt(x)\\) \\(f(x) = \\ln(2x)\\) \\(f(x) = e^{x}\\) \\(f(x) = \\frac{9}{x^2} + ln(4x)\\) \\(f(x) = 4x−6x^6\\) \\(f(x) = \\frac{3}{x^2}\\) Answers to selected exercises (differentiation) Exr. 4.1 \\(f(x) = 2\\), \\(f&#39;(x) = 0\\) \\(f(x) = 2x + 1\\), \\(f&#39;(x) = 2\\) \\(f(x) = 5x^2\\), \\(f&#39;(x)= 10x\\) \\(f(x) = 4x^3 + x^2\\), \\(f&#39;(x)=12x^2 + 2x\\) \\(f(x) = \\sqrt(x) = x^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\), \\(f&#39;(x)=\\frac{1}{2}x^{\\frac{1}{2}-1} = \\frac{1}{2}x^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\) \\(f(x) = \\ln(2x)\\), \\(f&#39;(x) = \\frac{1}{x}\\) \\(f(x) = e^{x}\\), \\(f&#39;(x) = e^x\\) "],["integration.html", "Chapter 5 Integration 5.1 Reverse to differentiation 5.2 What is constant of integration? 5.3 Table of integrals 5.4 Definite integrals 5.5 Exercises: integration Answers to selected exercises (integration)", " Chapter 5 Integration Aims to introduce the concept of integration Learning outcomes to be able to explain what integration is to be able to explain the relationship between differentiation and integration to be able to integrate simple functions to to able to use integration to calculate the area under the curve in simple cases 5.1 Reverse to differentiation when a function \\(f(x)\\) is known we can differentiate it to obtain the derivative \\(f&#39;(x)\\) the reverse process is to obtain \\(f(x)\\) from the derivative this process is called integration apart from simple reversing differentiation integration comes very useful in finding areas under curves, i.e. the area above the x-axis and below the graph of \\(f(x)\\), assuming that \\(f(x)\\) is positive the symbol for integration is \\(\\int\\) and is known as “integral sign” E.g. let’s take a function \\(f(x) = x^2\\). Suppose we only have a derivative, which is \\(f&#39;(x) = 2x\\) and we would like to find the function given this derivative. Formally we write: \\[\\int 2x dx = x^2 +c\\] where: the term \\(2x\\) within the integral is called the integrand the term \\(dx\\) indicates the name of the variable involved, here \\(x\\) \\(c\\) is constant of integration 5.2 What is constant of integration? Integration reverses the process of differentiation, here, given our example function \\(f(x) = x^2\\) that we pretended we do not know, we started with the derivative \\(f´(x) = 2x\\) and via integration we obtained back the very function \\[\\int 2x dx = x^2\\] However, many function can result in the very same derivative since the derivative of a constant is 0 e.g. a derivatives of \\(f(x) = x^2\\), \\(f(x) = x^2 + 10\\) and \\(f(x) = x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\) all equal to \\(f&#39;(x) = 2x\\) We have to take this into account when we are integrating, i.e. reverting differentiation. As we have no way of knowing what the original function constant is, we add it in form of \\(c\\), i.e. unknown constant, called the constant of integration. 5.3 Table of integrals Similar to differentiation, in practice we can use tables of integrals to be able to find integrals in simple cases Table 5.1: Common functions and their integrals, \\(k\\) denotes a constant Function \\(f(x)\\) Integral \\(\\int f(x) dx\\) \\(constant\\:k\\) \\(kx + c\\) \\(x\\) \\(\\frac{x^2}{2}+c\\) \\(kx\\) \\(k\\frac{x^2}{2}+c\\) \\(x^n\\) \\(\\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}+c\\;\\; if\\;n\\neq-1\\) \\(kx^n\\) \\(k\\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}+c\\) \\(e^x\\) \\(e^x+c\\) \\(e^{kx}\\) \\(\\frac{e^{kx}}{k}+c\\) \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\) \\(\\ln(x)+c\\) E.g. \\(\\int 4x^3 dx = \\frac{4x^{3+1}}{3+1}=x^4 + c\\) \\(\\int (x^2 + x) dx = \\frac{x^3}{3} + \\frac{x^2}{2} +c\\) (note: we can evaluate integrals separately and add them as integration as differentiation is linear) 5.4 Definite integrals the above examples of integrals are indefinite integrals, the result of finding an indefinite integral is usually a function plus a constant of integration we have also definite integrals, so called because the result is a definite answer, usually a number, with no constant of integration definite integrals are often used to areas bounded by curves or, as we will cover later on, estimating probabilities we write: \\[\\int_{a}^bf(x)dx\\] where: \\(\\int_{a}^bf(x)dx\\) is called the definite integral of \\(f(x)\\) from \\(a\\) to \\(b\\) the numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are known as lower and upper limits of the integral E.g. let’s look at the function \\(f(x) = x\\) plotted below and calculate a definite integral from \\(0\\) to \\(2\\). Figure 5.1: Graph of function \\(f(x) = x\\) We write \\[\\int_{0}^2f(x)dx = \\int_{0}^2 xdx = \\Bigr[ \\frac{1}{2}x^2\\Bigr]_0^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(2)^2 - \\frac{1}{2}(0)^2 = 2\\] so first find the integral and then we evaluate it at upper limit and subtracting the evaluation at the lower limit.

The formula for the triangle area is \\(Area = \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot base \\cdot height\\) so here \\(Area = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 2\\) the same result as achieved with integration. 5.5 Exercises: integration Exercise 5.1 Integrate: \\(\\int 2 \\cdot dx\\) \\(\\int 2x\\cdot dx\\) \\(\\int (x^4 + x^2 + 1)\\cdot dx\\) \\(\\int e^x\\cdot dx\\) \\(\\int e^{2x}\\cdot dx\\) \\(\\int \\frac{2}{x}\\cdot dx\\) \\(\\int_2^4 2x\\cdot dx\\) \\(\\int_0^4 (x^2+1)dx\\) \\(\\int (x^4 + \\frac{2}{x} + e^{2x}) dx\\) \\(\\int_0^4 (x^4+1) dx\\) Answers to selected exercises (integration) Exr. 5.1 \\(\\int 2 \\cdot dx = 2x +c\\) \\(\\int 2x\\cdot dx = \\frac{2x^2}{2} = x^2 + c\\) \\(\\int (x^4 + x^2 + 1)\\cdot dx = \\frac{x^5}{5} + \\frac{x^3}{3} + x + c\\) \\(\\int e^x\\cdot dx = e^x + c\\) \\(\\int e^{2x}\\cdot dx = \\frac{1}{2}e^{2x}\\) \\(\\int \\frac{2}{x}\\cdot dx =\\int 2\\cdot \\frac{1}{x}\\cdot dx = 2 \\ln{x}+ c\\) \\(\\int_2^4 2x\\cdot dx = \\Bigr[x^2\\Bigr]_2^4 = 16 - 4 = 12\\) \\(\\int_0^4 (x^2+1)dx = \\Bigr[\\frac{x^3}{3} + x \\Bigr]_0^4=\\frac{4^3}{3}+4 - 0 = \\frac{64}{3}+4 = \\frac{76}{3}\\) "],["vectors.html", "Chapter 6 Vectors 6.1 Vectors 6.2 Operations on vectors 6.3 Null and unit vector 6.4 Exercises: vectors Answers to selected exercises (vectors and matrices)", " Chapter 6 Vectors Aims to introduce vectors and basic vectors operations Learning outcomes to be able to write \\(n\\)-dimensional vectors using vector notations to be able to perform addition and scalar multiplication to be able to check if two vectors are orthogonal A large number of statistical models use vectors and matrices, both for compact representations, and for the calculations, e.g. parameter estimates. 6.1 Vectors A vector is an ordered set of number These numbers, e.g. in vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) can be expressed as a row \\(\\mathbf{x}=[6\\quad 0\\quad 5 \\dots1]\\) or as a column \\(\\mathbf{x}=\\begin{bmatrix} 6 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 5 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}\\) the number of elements in a vector is referred to as its dimension and we often use \\(n\\) to express \\(n\\)-dimensional vector, where \\(n\\) can be any natural number here, we denote vectors using small bold font \\(\\mathbf{x}\\), other notations may include an arrow \\(\\vec x\\) or overline \\(\\overline{x}\\) also parentheses are used interchangeably with square bracket, e.g. \\(\\mathbf{x}=[6\\quad 0\\quad 5 \\dots1]\\) can be written as \\(\\mathbf{x}=(6\\quad 0\\quad 5 \\dots1)\\) or \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 6\\\\ 0\\\\ 5\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\) 6.2 Operations on vectors Given two vectors of the same dimension: \\(\\mathbf{x}=\\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ x_n \\end{bmatrix}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{y}=\\begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\\\ y_3 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_n \\end{bmatrix}\\) Addition: we add two vectors, element by element \\(\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{y}=\\begin{bmatrix} x_1 + y_1 \\\\ x_2 + y_2 \\\\ x_3 + y_3 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ x_n + y_n \\end{bmatrix}\\) Scalar multiplication: we can multiple vector by a numerical value, scalar, denoted as \\(\\gamma\\): \\[\\gamma \\cdot \\mathbf{x} =\\begin{bmatrix} \\gamma \\cdot x_1 \\\\ \\gamma \\cdot x_2 \\\\ \\gamma \\cdot x_3 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\gamma \\cdot x_n \\end{bmatrix}\\] Difference \\(\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{y}\\) can be written as \\(\\mathbf{x} + (-1) \\cdot \\mathbf{y}\\), thus we multiply second vector with \\(-1\\) and then add two vectors Linear combination of vectors: the vector \\(\\gamma \\cdot \\mathbf{x} + \\delta \\cdot \\mathbf{y}\\) is said to be a linear combination of \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{y}\\): \\[\\gamma \\cdot \\mathbf{x} + \\delta \\cdot \\mathbf{y} =\\begin{bmatrix} \\gamma \\cdot x_1 + \\delta \\cdot y_1 \\\\ \\gamma \\cdot x_2 + \\delta \\cdot y_2\\\\ \\gamma \\cdot x_3 + \\delta \\cdot y_3\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\gamma \\cdot x_n + \\delta \\cdot y_n \\end{bmatrix}\\] Inner product of vectors is given by: \\[\\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{y} = x_1 \\cdot y_1 + x_2 \\cdot y_2 + \\dots x_n \\cdot y_n = \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i\\cdot y_i\\] Orthogonality of vectors: two vectors are said to be orthogonal if their inner product is zero \\[\\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{y} =\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i\\cdot y_i = 0\\] 6.3 Null and unit vector a null vector is a vector whose elements are all \\(0\\);

We then can write: \\[\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = \\begin{bmatrix} x_{11} &amp; x_{12} &amp; x_{13} \\\\ x_{21} &amp; x_{22} &amp; x_{23} \\end{bmatrix} \\times \\begin{bmatrix} y_{11} &amp; y_{12} \\\\ y_{21} &amp; y_{22} \\\\ y_{31} &amp; y_{32} \\end{bmatrix} = \\\\\\ \\begin{bmatrix} x_{11} \\cdot y_{11} + x_{12} \\cdot y_{21} + x_{13} \\cdot y_{31} &amp; x_{11} \\cdot y_{12} + x_{12} \\cdot y_{22} + x_{13} \\cdot y_{32} \\\\ x_{21} \\cdot y_{11} + x_{22} \\cdot y_{21} + x_{23} \\cdot y_{31} &amp; x_{21} \\cdot y_{12} + x_{22} \\cdot y_{22} + x_{23} \\cdot y_{32} \\end{bmatrix}\\] 7.4 Inverse of a matrix For a square matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) there may exist a matrix \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) such that \\(\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = \\mathbf{I}\\). An inverse, if it exists, is denoted as \\(\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\\) and we can rewrite the definition as \\[\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{A}^{-1} = \\mathbf{I}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{I}\\) is an identify matrix (equivalent to 1). There is no division for matrices, instead we can use inverse to multiply the matrix by an inverse, similar to when instead of dividing the number \\(a\\) by \\(b\\) we multiply \\(a\\) by reciprocal of \\(b = \\frac{1}{b}\\) For a 2-dimensional matrix we can follow the below formula for obtaining the inverse \\[\\begin{bmatrix} x_{11} &amp; x_{12} \\\\ x_{21} &amp; x_{22} \\end{bmatrix}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{x_{11} \\cdot x_{22} - x_{12} \\cdot x_{21}} \\cdot \\begin{bmatrix} x_{22} &amp; -x_{12} \\\\ -x_{21} &amp; x_{11} \\end{bmatrix}\\] 7.5 Orthogonal matrix A matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) for which \\(\\mathbf{A^\\top} = \\mathbf{A^{-1}}\\) is true is said to be orthogonal 7.6 Exercises: matrices Exercise 7.1 Given matrices \\(\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 \\\\ 3 &amp; 4 \\end{bmatrix}\\), \\(\\mathbf{B} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{C} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 2 \\end{bmatrix}\\) what is the dimension of matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\)? what is \\(\\mathbf{A}^\\top\\)? which of the matrices is i) an identity matrix ii) a square matrix, iii) null matrix, iv) diagonal matrix, v) a triangular matrix,? calculate \\(\\mathbf{A} + \\mathbf{B}\\)? calculate \\(\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{C}\\)? calculate \\(\\mathbf{B}^\\top\\) calculate \\(\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\\) calculate \\((\\mathbf{A} + \\mathbf{B})^{-1}\\) answer again a) - h) this time using R functions and/or commands Answers to selected exercises (matrices) Exr. 7.1 \\(2 \\times 2\\) \\(\\mathbf{A}^\\top = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 3 \\\\ 2 &amp; 4 \\end{bmatrix}\\) identity matrix: \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), ii) a square matrix: \\(\\mathbf{A}\\), \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{C}\\), iii) null matrix: none, iv) diagonal matrix: \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) (identity matrix is diagonal) and \\(\\mathbf{C}\\), v) triangular \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) as both identify matrix \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) and diagonal matrix \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) is triangular, both lower and upper triangular \\(\\mathbf{A} + \\mathbf{B} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 \\\\ 3 &amp; 4 \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 &amp; 2 \\\\ 3 &amp; 5 \\end{bmatrix}\\) \\(\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{C} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\cdot 1 + 2 \\cdot 0 &amp; 1 \\cdot 0 + 2 \\cdot 2 \\\\ 3 \\cdot 1 + 4 \\cdot 0 &amp; 3 \\cdot 0 + 4 \\cdot 2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 4 \\\\ 3 &amp; 8 \\end{bmatrix}\\) \\(\\mathbf{B}^\\top = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix}\\) \\[\\mathbf{A}^{-1} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 \\\\ 3 &amp; 4 \\end{bmatrix}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{1 \\cdot 4 - 2 \\cdot 3} \\cdot \\begin{bmatrix} 4 &amp; -2 \\\\ -3 &amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\begin{bmatrix} 4 &amp; -2 \\\\ -3 &amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} -2 &amp; 1 \\\\ \\frac{3}{2} &amp; -\\frac{1}{2} \\end{bmatrix}\\] "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
