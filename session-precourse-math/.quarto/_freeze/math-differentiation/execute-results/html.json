Figure \\@ref(fig:diff-01) shows a function $f(x)$ with two possible argument values $a$ and $b$ marked and their corresponding function values $f(a)$ and $f(b)$. \n\nConsider that $x$ is increasing from $a$ to $b$. The change in $x$ is $b-a$, i.e. as $x$ increases from $a$ to $b$ the function $f(x)$ increase from $f(a)$ to $f(b)$. The change in $f(x)$ is $f(b)-f(a)$ and the average rate of change of $y$ across the $[a,b]$ interval is:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{change\\:in\\:y}{change\\:in\\:x}=\\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}\n(\\#eq:diff-point)\n\\end{equation}\n\n\nE.g. let's take a quadratic function $f(x)=x^2$ and calculate the average rate of change across the interval $[1, 4]$. \n\n- The change in $x$ is $4-1$ and the change in $f(x)$ is $f(4) - f(1) = 4^2 -1^2 = 16 - 1 = 15$. So the average rate of change is $\\frac{15}{3}=5$. What does this mean? It means that across the interval $[1,4]$ on average the $f(x)$ value increases by 5 for every 1 unit increase in $x$. \n- If we were to look at the average rate of change across the interval $[-2, 0]$ we would get $\\frac{f(0)-f(-2)}{0 - (-2)}=\\frac{0 - (-2)^2}{2}=\\frac{-4}{2} = -2$. Here, over the $[-2, 0]$ on average the $f(x)$ value decreases by 2 for every 1 unit increase in $x$. \n- Looking at the graph of $f(x)=x^2$ verifies our calculations\n\n\n::: {.cell .fig-cap-location-margin layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Example function $f(x) = x^2$](math-differentiation_files/figure-html/diff-avg-rate-1.png){fig-align='center' width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Rate of change at a point\n- We often need to know the rate of change of a function at a point, and not simply an average rate of change across an interval.\n- Figure \\@ref(fig:diff-02), similar to Figure \\@ref(fig:diff-01), shows, instead of two points $a$ and $b$, point $a$ and a second point defined in terms of its distance from the first point $a$. Thus, the two points are now $a$ and $a + h$ and the distance between the two points is equal to $h$.\n- Now we can write that:\n$$\\frac{change\\:in\\:y}{change\\:in\\:x}=\\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{a+h-a} = \\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}$$\n\n\n::: {.cell .fig-cap-location-margin layout-align=\"center\" fig.dpi='300'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The average rate of change of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ over $[a, b]$ is equal to the slope of the secant line (in black)](figures/precourse/math-differentiation-02.png){fig-align='center' width=8in height=5in}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nFurther:\n\n- if we assume that the second point $a+h$ is really close to $a$, meaning that $h$ approaches 0, denoted as $h \\rightarrow 0$, we can find the rate of change at the point $a$\n- the distance between the two points $a$ and $a+h$ is getting smaller and so is the difference of the function values $f(a+h) - f(a)$. We denote these small differences as $\\delta x$ and $\\delta y$, pronounced \"delta x\" and \"delta y\", respectively. \n- the term $\\delta$ reads as \"delta\" and represents a small change\n\nWe can thus continue and write that a **rate of change of a function at a point** is given by\n\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{small\\:change\\:in\\:y}{small\\:change\\:in\\:x} = \\lim_{h\\to0}\\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}\n(\\#eq:diff-point-2)\n\\end{equation}\n\n<br />\n\nE.g. let's look at the linear function $f(x) = 2x+3$. We can find the rate of change at any point of $x$ by:\n$$\\frac{small\\:change\\:in\\:y}{small\\:change\\:in\\:x} = \\\\\\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{x+h-x}= \\lim_{h\\to0}\\frac{2(x+h)+3-(2x+3)}{x+h-x}=\\lim_{h\\to0}\\frac{2h}{h}=2$$\nIt means that the function value $f(x)$ increases by 2 for every small increase, $h$, in $x$. Here, this increase is the same for all the values of $x$, i.e. it does not depend on $x$. **The change in function value $f(x)$ can depend** on the value of $x$, for instance if we look at the quadratic $f(x)=x^2$ function, we get:\n$$\\frac{small\\:change\\:in\\:y}{small\\:change\\:in\\:x} = \\\\ \\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{x+h-x}=\\lim_{h\\to0}\\frac{x^2+2xh+h^2-x^2}{h}=\\lim_{h\\to0}\\frac{2xh+h^2}{h}=2x+h$$\n<br />\nThis means that:\n\n- the rate of change for the function $f(x)$ at a point $x$ is $2x$\n- the $f(x)$ value increases by $2x$ for every small increase, $h$, in $x$\n- the rate of change along a quadratic function is changing constantly according to the value of $x$ we are looking at, it is a function of $x$\n- and finally that the rate of change does not give us any information about the rate of change globally.\n\n## Terminology and notation\n- **differentiation** is the process of finding the rate of change of a given function\n- the function is said to be **differentiated**\n- the rate of change of a function is also known as the **derivative** of the function\n- given a function $f(x)$ we say that we differentiate function in respect to $x$ and write:\n\n$$\\lim_{h\\to0}\\frac{\\delta y}{\\delta x}= \\frac{dy}{dx}$$\n\nor use the \"prime\" $$f´(x)$$\n\n## Table of derivatives\n- in practice, there is no need to compute $\\displaystyle \\lim_{h\\to0}\\frac{\\delta y}{\\delta x}$ every time when we want to find a derivative of a function\n- instead, we can use patterns of the common functions and their derivatives\n\n|Function $f(x)$ | Derivative $f'(x)$ |\n| :-----------: | :-----------: |\n|$k$ | $0$|\n|$x$ | $1$|\n|$kx$ | $k$|\n|$x^n$ | $nx^{n-1}$|\n|$kx^n$ | $knx^{n-1}$|\n|$e^x$ | $e^x$|\n|$e^{kx}$ | $ke^{kx}$|\n|$\\ln(x)$ | $\\frac{1}{x}$|\n|$\\ln(kx)$ | $\\frac{1}{x}$|\n: Common functions and their derivatives, $k$ denotes a constant {#tbl-diff} \n\nWe can use @tbl-diff to find derivatives of some of the functions e.g.\n\n- $f(x) = 3x$, $f'(x) = 3$\n- $f(x) = 2x^4$, $f'(x) = 2*4x^{4-1} = 8x^3$\n- $f(x) = e^{2x}$, $f'(x) = 2e^{2x}$\n- $f(x) = \\ln(4x)$, $f'(x) = \\frac{1}{x}$\n\n\n## Exercises {-}\n\n::: {#exr-m-diff}\n\nFind derivatives of the functions\n\na) $f(x) = 2$\nb) $f(x) = 2x + 1$\nc) $f(x) = 5x^2$\nd) $f(x) = 4x^3 + x^2$\ne) $f(x) = \\sqrt(x)$\nf) $f(x) = \\ln(2x)$\ng) $f(x) = e^{x}$\nh) $f(x) = \\frac{9}{x^2} + ln(4x)$\ni) $f(x) = 4x−6x^6$\nj) $f(x) = \\frac{3}{x^2}$\n\n:::\n\n## Answers {-}\n\n::: {.solution}\n@exr-m-diff\n:::\n\na) $f(x) = 2$, $f'(x) = 0$\nb) $f(x) = 2x + 1$, $f'(x) = 2$\nc) $f(x) = 5x^2$, $f'(x)= 10x$\nd) $f(x) = 4x^3 + x^2$, $f'(x)=12x^2 + 2x$\ne) $f(x) = \\sqrt(x) = x^{\\frac{1}{2}}$, $f'(x)=\\frac{1}{2}x^{\\frac{1}{2}-1} = \\frac{1}{2}x^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$\nf) $f(x) = \\ln(2x)$, $f'(x) = \\frac{1}{x}$\ng) $f(x) = e^{x}$, $f'(x) = e^x$\nh) $f(x) = \\frac{9}{x^2} + ln(4x)$\ni) $f(x) = 4x−6x^6$\nj) $f(x) = \\frac{3}{x^2}$\n\n",
