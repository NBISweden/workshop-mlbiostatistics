To be able to use it it is essential to learn symbols and understand how they are used to represent physical quantities as well as understand the rules and conventions that have been developed to manipulate them.\n\n- **variables**: things that can vary, e.g. temperature and time\n- **constants**: fixed and unchanging quantities used in certain calculations, e.g. 3.14159\n- in principle one could freely choose letters and symbols to represent variables and constants, but it is helpful and choose letters and symbols that have meaning in a particular context. Hence, we\n- $x, y, z$, the end of the alphabet is reserved for variables\n- $a, b, c$, the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent constants\n- $\\pi$, $\\omega$ and Greek letters below are used frequently used to represent common constant, e.g. $\\pi = 3.14159$\n\n| Letter | Upper case | Lower case | Letter | Upper case | Lower case |\n| :----------- | :----------- | :-------  | :----------- | :----------- | :-------  |\n| Alpha | A | $\\alpha$ | Nu | N | $\\nu$ |\n| Beta | B | $\\beta$ | Xi | $\\Xi$ | $\\xi$ |\n| Gamma | $\\Gamma$ | $\\gamma$ | Omicron | O | o |\n| Delta | $\\Delta$ | $\\delta$ | Pi | $\\Pi$ | $\\pi$ |\n| Epsilon | E | $\\epsilon$ | Rho | P | $\\rho$ |\n| Zeta | Z | $\\zeta$ | Sigma | $\\Sigma$ | $\\sigma$ |\n| Eta | H | $\\eta$ | Tau | T | $\\tau$ |\n| Theta | $\\Theta$ | $\\theta$ | Upsilon | Y | $\\upsilon$ |\n| Iota | I  | $\\iota$ | Phi | $\\Phi$ | $\\phi$ |\n| Kappa | K | $\\kappa$| Chi | X | $\\chi$ |\n| Lambda | $\\Lambda$ | $\\lambda$ | Psi | $\\Psi$ | $\\psi$ |\n| Mu | M | $\\mu$ | Omega | $\\Omega$ | $\\omega$ |\nTable: (\\#tab:greek-table) Uppercase and lowercase letters of the Greek alphabet\n\n## A precise language\n- Mathematics is a precise language meaning that a special attention has to be paid to the exact position of any symbol in relation to other.\n- Given two symbols $x$ and $y$, $xy$ and $x^y$ and $x_y$ can mean different things\n- $xy$ stands for multiplication, $x^y$ for superscript and $x_y$ for subscript\n\n## Using symbols\nIf the letters $x$ and $y$ represent two numbers, then:\n\n- their **sum** is written as $x + y$\n- subtracting $y$ from $x$ is $x - y$, known also as **difference**\n- to multiply $x$ and $y$ we written as $x \\cdot y$ or also with the multiplication signed omitted as $xy$. The quantity is known as **product of x and y**\n- multiplication is **associative**, e.g. when we multiply three numbers together, $x \\cdot y \\cdot z$, the order of multiplication does not matter, so $x \\cdot y \\cdot z$ is the same as $z \\cdot x \\cdot y$ or $y \\cdot z \\cdot x$\n- division is denoted by $\\frac{x}{y}$ and means that $x$ is divided by $y$. In this expression $x$, on the top, is called **numerator** and $y$, on the bottom, is called **denominator**\n- division by 1 leaves any number unchanged, e.g. $\\frac{x}{1}=x$ and division by 0 is not allowed\n\n<br />\n\nEqual sign\n\n- the equal sign $=$ is used in **equations**, e.g. $x - 5  = 0$ or $5x = 1$\n- the equal sign $=$ can be also used in **formulae**. Physical quantities are related through a formula in many fields, e.g. the formula $A=\\pi r^2$ relates circle area $A$ to its radius $r$ and the formula $s = \\frac{d}{t}$ defines speed as distance $d$ divided by time $t$\n- the equal sign $=$ is also used in identities, expressions true for all values of the variable, e.g. $(x-1)(x-1) = (x^2-1)$\n- opposite to the equal sign is \"is not equal to\" sign $\\neq$, e.g. we can write $1+2 \\neq 4$\n\n<br />\n\n**Sigma and Product notation**\n\n- the $\\Sigma$ notation, read as **Sigma notation**, provides a convenient way of writing long sums, e.g. the sum of $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + ... + x_{20}$ is written as $\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^{i=20}x_i$\n- the $\\Pi$ notation, read as **Product notation**, provides a convenient way of writing long products, e.g.  $x_1 \\cdot x_2 \\cdot x_3 \\cdot ... \\cdot x_{20}$ is written as $\\displaystyle \\prod_{i=1}^{i=20}x_i$\n\n## Inequalities\nGiven any two real numbers $a$ and $b$ there are three mutually exclusive possibilities:\n\n- $a > b$, meaning that $a$ is greater than $b$\n- $a < b$, meaning that $a$ is less than $b$\n- $a = b$, meaning that $a$ is equal to $b$\n\n<br />\n\nStrict and weak\n\n- inequality in $a > b$ and $a < b$ is **strict**\n- as oppose to **weak** inequality denoted as $a \\ge b$ or $a \\le b$\n\n<br />\nSome useful relations are:\n\n- if $a > b$ and $b > c$ then $a > c$\n- if $a > b$ then $a + c > b$ for any positive $c$\n- if $a > b$ then $ac > bc$ for any positive $c$\n- if $a > b$ then $ac < bc$ for any negative $c$\n\n## Indices and powers\n- **Indices**, also known as **powers** are convenient when we multiply a number by itself several times\n- e.g. $5 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 5$ is written as $5^3$ and $4 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 4$ is written as $4^5$\n- in the expression $x^y$, $x$ is called the *base* and $y$ is called *index* or *power*\n\nThe laws of indices state:\n\n- $a^m \\cdot a^n = a^{m+n}$\n- $\\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}$\n- $(a^m)^n = a^{m\\cdot n}$\n\nRules derived from the laws of indices:\n\n- $a^0 = 1$\n- $a^1 = a$\n\nNegative and fractional indices:\n\n- $a^{-m} = \\frac{1}{a^m}$ e.g. $5^{-2} = \\frac{1}{5^2} = \\frac{1}{25}$ for negative indices\n- e.g. $4^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\sqrt{4}$ or $8^{\\frac{1}{3}} = \\sqrt[3]{8}$ for fractional indices\n\n--------\n\n\n## Exercises: notations {-}\n\n::: {#exr-m-notations-numbers}\n\n### Types of numbers\n\nClassify numbers as natural, integers or real.
