Every set is a subset of itself.\n-   **superset**: for our outs $A$ and $B$ we can also say that $B$ is a **superset** of $A$ and write $B \\supset A$\n\n<br />\n\n-   **cardinality**: the number of elements within a set $S$, denoted as $|S|$\n-   **empty set,** $\\emptyset$: is a unique set with no members, denoted by $E = \\emptyset$ or $E = \\{\\}$. The empty set is a subset of every set.\n\n## Basic set operations\n\n-   **union of two sets,** $\\cup$ : two sets can be \"added\" together, the union of A and B, written as $A \\cup B$, e.g. $\\{1, 2\\} \\cup \\{2, 3\\} = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ or $\\{1, 2, 3\\} \\cup \\{1, 4, 5, 6\\} = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$\n-   **intersection of two sets,** $\\cap$: a new set can be constructed by taking members of two sets that are \"in common\", written as $A \\cap B$, e.g. $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\} \\cap \\{2, 3, 7\\} = \\{2, 3\\}$ or $\\{1, 2, 3\\} \\cap \\{7 \\} = \\{\\emptyset \\}$\n\n<br/>\n\n-   **complement of a set,** $A'$, $A^c$: are the elements not in A\n-   **difference of two sets,** $\\setminus$: two sets can be \"subtracted\", denoted by $A \\setminus B$, by taking all elements that are members of A but are not members of B, e.g. $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\setminus \\{1, 3\\} = \\{2, 4\\}$. This is also in other words a relative complement of A with respect to B.\n\n<br/>\n\n-   **partition of a set**: a partition of a set S is a set of nonempty subset of S, such that every element x in S is in exactly one of these subsets. That is, the subset are pairwise *disjoint*, meaning no two sets of the partition contain elements in common, and the union of all the subset of the partition is S, e.g. Set $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$ has five partitions: i) $\\{1\\}, \\{2\\}, \\{3\\}$, ii) $\\{1, 2\\}, \\{3\\}$, iii) $\\{1,3\\}, \\{2\\}$, iv) $\\{1\\}, \\{2, 3\\}$ and v) $\\{1,2,3\\}$\n\n## Venn diagrams\n\nVenn diagram is a diagram that shows all possible logical relations between a finite collection of different sets. A Venn diagram shows elements as points in the plane, and sets as regions inside closed curves. A Venn diagram consists of multiple overlapping closed curves, usually circles, each representing a set.\n\nE.g. given $A = \\{1, 2, 5\\}$ and $B = \\{1, 6\\}$ Venn diagram of $A$ and $B$:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](math-sets_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){fig-align='center' width=480}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd given $A = \\{1, 2, 5\\}$, $B = \\{1, 6\\}$ and $C= \\{4, 7\\}$ Venn diagram of $A$, $B$ and $C$:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](math-sets_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){fig-align='center' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd given $A = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$ and $B= \\{2, 4, 6\\}$ Venn diagram of $A$ and $B$:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](math-sets_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){fig-align='center' width=480}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Exercises\n\n::: {#exr-m-sets-01}\n\n### Subsets I\n\nGiven set $S = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$:\n  \na) what is $T$, a subset of $S$ consisting of its even elements?\nb) what is the complement $T^c$? \nc) what is $U$, the subset of $S$ containing of the prime numbers in $S$?\nd) what is the intersection $T \\cap U$? \ne) what is the union of $T \\cup U$?\nf) what is the set difference $U \\setminus T$?\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {#exr-m-sets-02}\n\n### Subsets II\n\nGiven set $$A = \\{domestic \\;cat, elephant, dog, turtle, goldfish, hamster, parrot, tiger, guinea\\; pig, lion\\}$$ and its subset $D$ of domesticated animals $D = \\{domestic \\;cat, dog, turtle, goldfish, hamster, parrot, guinea \\;pig\\}$\n  \na) what is $D^c$, the complement of $D$?\nb) what is $C$, subset of $A$ consisting of Felidae (cat) family?\nb) what is $I$, the intersection of $D$ and $C$?\nd) what is $U$, the union of $D^c$ and $C$?\ne) what is $Z$, the set difference of $A \\setminus C$?\nf) can you draw Venn diagram showing relationship between $D$ and $C$?\n  \n:::\n\n## Answers {-}\n\n::: {.solution}\n@exr-m-sets-01\n:::\n\na)  $T = \\{2, 4, 6\\}$\nb)  $T^c = \\{1, 3, 5\\}$, i.e. $T^c$ contains all the elements of $S$ not in $T$\nc)  $U = \\{2, 3, 5\\}$, the primes in $S$\nd)  $T \\cap U = \\{2\\}$, common elements of $T$ and $U$, i.e. the even and prime numbers\ne)  $T \\cup U = \\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$\nf)  $U \\setminus T = \\{3, 5\\}$, consisting of the elements of $U$ that are not in $T$\n\n\n::: {.solution}\n@exr-m-sets-02\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\na) $D^c = \\{elephant, tiger, lion\\}$\nb) $C = \\{domsetic \\;cat, tiger, lion\\}$\nc) $I = \\{domestic \\;cat\\}$\nd) $U = \\{domestic \\;cat, elephant, tiger, lion\\}$\ne) $Z = \\{elephant, dog, turtle, goldfish, hamster, parrot, guinea \\;pig\\}$\nf) \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](math-sets_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){fig-align='center' width=480}\n:::\n:::\n",
