# Work in progress notes

## Pre-course

- fix typo in the title "Mathematical foundations"
- add sets visualizaiton e.g. from here https://people.tamu.edu/~j-epstein//eHW/C1a.pdf
- add matrix operations as visualizations
- go through quiz stats from V23 and see if any improvements to the quiz or materials are needed
- make sure inverse of matrix is in the math pre-course together with R functions

## Overall

- refresh mathematical foundation quiz
- refresh daily challenges
- add slides summaries / what's beyond recommendations

## Descriptive statistics

- add examples and/or more about formatting figures
- add literature and further information

## Non-parametric tests

- refresh & improve
- ask how it went / who they did it

## Linear models

- add code to get data again in exercises
- exercises 1: clarify that the goal is to fit one model (remove typo indicating otherwise)
- in the chapter change Poisson example to age, and compare predicted age values with Poisson glm vs. lm() to show that we can count data now
- add plot and proper explanation of predicting outside the range, perhaps a classical example of height vs. age in children and adults
- add edgeR explanation distributions to GLM
- complete all common cases with the same structure: coefficients interpretation, hypothesis testing, model fit, predictions, assumptions
- improve model assumptions section, better examples when assumptions are not met
- add exercises for common cases and/or additional practise quiz
- change examples in the daily challenge
- have more on design matrix
- add more on logistic regression, including odds ratios and risk etc.
- improve explanation of assumpionts: trend in increased variance, examples of RNA-seq data?

## PCA

- tiny example of eigendecompostion?

## Clustering

- check and make new exercises given new session
- dendorgram plots side by side to compare linkage?

## Supervised learning

- make overview plot: machine learning
  - supervised: classification and regression
  - unsupervised: clustering
  - reinforcment learning
- minor: include ROC curve example
- make slides more attractive

## Feature engineering and selection

- keep engineerign shorter and regularization longer or start from regularization? (took too much time)
- add pictres of skewed distributions density plots
- exercises: add assumptions about prevelance of diabetes
- prepare live demo worksheet
- improve slides

## Generic comments

- add transformations to descriptive stats
- how to solve keeping the history of the materials?
