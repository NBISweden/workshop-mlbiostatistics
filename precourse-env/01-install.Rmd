## Markdown 
- Markdown (.md) is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plain text documents. [https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/). Originally, Markdown had nothing to do with R. 
- The common formatting options in Markdown are summarized in [https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) 

## R Markdown 
- R Markdown (.Rmd) allows to combine typing text in `Markdown` and execute code in `R`. It is thus great to document data analysis. 
- A short introduction to R Markdown is under [https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_intro.html](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_intro.html)
- To open R Markdown in RStudio click `File` -> `New File` -> `R Markdown`

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width = "600px", fig.cap = "Opening new R Markdown file within RStudio"}
include_graphics("figures/RStudio-Rmd.png", dpi = 600)
````
- This opens an `Untitled.Rmd` document with example usage of text writing using Markdown and embedded R code in so called `code chunks`. To render .Rmd into .HTML press `Knitr` button. This should generate .HTML file. 
```{r, fig.align='center', out.width = "600px", fig.cap = "Rendering .Rmd with Knitr"}
include_graphics("figures/RStudio-knit.png", dpi = 600)
````
