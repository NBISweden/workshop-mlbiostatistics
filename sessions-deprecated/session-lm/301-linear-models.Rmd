# Introduction to linear models 

**Aims**

- to introduce concept of linear models using simple linear regression

**Learning outcomes**

- to understand what a linear model is and be familiar with the terminology
- to be able to state linear model in the general vector-matrix notation
- to be able to use the general vector-matrix notation to numerically estimate model parameters
- to be able to use `lm()` function for model fitting, parameter estimation, hypothesis testing and prediction

## Why linear models? With linear models we can answer questions such as: 
  - is there a relationship between exposure and outcome, e.g. body weight and plasma volume?
  - how strong is the relationship between the two variables?
  - what will be a predicted value of the outcome given a new set of exposure values?
  - how accurately can we predict outcome?
  - which variables are associated with the response, e.g. is it body weight and height that can explain the plasma volume or is it just the body weight?

## Statistical vs. deterministic relationship

Relationships in probability and statistics can generally be one of three things: deterministic, random, or statistical:

- a **deterministic** relationship involves **an exact relationship** between two variables, for instance Fahrenheit and Celsius degrees is defined by an equation $Fahrenheit=\frac{9}{5}\cdot Celcius+32$
- there is **no relationship** between variables in the **random relationship**, for instance number of succulents Olga buys and time of the year as Olga keeps buying succulents whenever she feels like it throughout the entire year
- **a statistical relationship** is a **mixture of deterministic and random relationship**, e.g. the savings that Olga has left in the bank account depend on Olga's monthly salary income (deterministic part) and the money spent on buying succulents (random part)

```{r regression-deterministic, echo=F, fig.height=5, fig.cap="Deterministic vs. statistical relationship: a) deterministic: equation exactly describes the relationship between the two variables e.g. Ferenheit and Celcius relationship ; b) statistical relationship between $x$ and $y$ is not perfect (increasing relationship), c)  statistical relationship between $x$ and $y$ is not perfect (decreasing relationship), d) random signal", fig.align="center", fig.height=6}

par(mfrow=c(2,2))#, mar=c(3,2,3,3))

# Deterministic relationship example
x_celcius <- seq(from=0, to=50, by=5)
y_fahr <- 9/5*x_celcius+32
plot(x_celcius, y_fahr, type="b", pch=19, xlab="Celcius", ylab="Fahrenheit", main="a) Deterministic", cex.main=0.8, las=2)

# Statistical relationship (increasing)
x <- seq(from=0, to=100, by=5)
y_increasing <- 2*x + rnorm(length(x), mean=100, sd=25)
plot(x, y_increasing, pch=19, xlab="x", ylab="y", main="b) Statistical", cex.main=0.8, las=2)

# Statistical relationship (decreasing)
y_decreasing <- -2*x + rnorm(length(x), mean=100, sd=25)
plot(x, y_decreasing, pch=19, xlab="x", ylab="y", main="c) Statistical", cex.main=0.8, las=2)

# Statistical relationship (random)

plot(x, y_random, pch=19, xlab="x", ylab="y", main="d) Random", cex.main=0.8, las=2)

```
  

## What linear models are and are not
- A linear model is one in which the parameters appear linearly in the deterministic part of the model 
- e.g. **simple linear regression** through the origin is a simple linear model of the form $$Y_i = \beta x + \epsilon$$ often used to express a relationship of **one numerical variable to another**, e.g. the calories burnt and the kilometers cycled
- linear models can become quite advanced by including **many variables**, e.g. the calories burnt could be a function of the kilometers cycled, road incline and status of bike, or the **transformation of the variables**, e.g. a function of kilometers cycled squared

More examples where model parameters appear linearly:

  a)  $Y_i = \alpha + \beta x_i + \gamma y_i + \epsilon_i$
  b) $Y_i = \alpha + \beta x_i^2 \epsilon$
  c) $Y_i = \alpha + \beta x_i^2 + \gamma x_i^3 + \epsilon$
  d) $Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \beta_2 x_i^2 + \beta_3 y_i + \beta_4 \sqrt {y_i} + \beta_5 x_i y_i + \epsilon$

and an example on a non-linear model where parameter $\beta$ appears in the exponent of $x_i$

  e)  $Y_i = \alpha + x_i^\beta +  \epsilon$

## Terminology
There are many terms and notations used interchangeably:

- $y$ is being called: 
  - response
  - outcome
  - dependent variable
- $x$ is being called: 
  - exposure
  - explanatory variable
  - dependent variable
  - predictor
  - covariate




## Simple linear regression
- It is used to check the association between **the numerical outcome and one numerical explanatory variable**
- In practice, we are finding the best-fitting straight line to describe the relationship between the outcome and exposure
- For example, let's look at the example data containing body weight (kg) and plasma volume (liters) for eight healthy men to see what the best-fitting straight line is. 

Example data:
```{r example-data}

weight <- c(58, 70, 74, 63.5, 62.0, 70.5, 71.0, 66.0) # body weight (kg)
plasma <- c(2.75, 2.86, 3.37, 2.76, 2.62, 3.49, 3.05, 3.12) # plasma volume (liters)

```


```{r fig-intro-example, echo=F, fig.align="center", fig.height=4, fig.width=4, fig.cap="Scatter plot of the data shows that high plasma volume tends to be associated with high weight and *vice verca*."}

plot(weight, plasma, pch=19, las=1, xlab = "body weight [kg]", ylab="plasma volume [l]",  panel.first = grid())
#abline(lm(plasma~weight), col="red") # regression line

```


```{r fig-intro-example-reg, echo=F, fig.align="center", fig.height=4, fig.width=4, fig.cap="Scatter plot of the data shows that high plasma volume tends to be associated with high weight and *vice verca*. Linear regression gives the equation of the straight line (red) that best describes how the outcome changes (increase or decreases) with a change of exposure variable"}

plot(weight, plasma, pch=19, las=1, xlab = "body weight [kg]", ylab="plasma volume [l]", panel.first = grid())

reg1 <- lm(plasma ~ weight)
a <- reg1$coefficients[1]
b <- reg1$coefficients[2]

abline(a=a+0.1 , b + 0.001, col="gray")
abline(a=a+0.1 , b + 0.0001, col="gray")
#abline(a=a , b + 0.00015, col="gray")
abline(a=a+0.1 , b + 0.002, col="gray")
abline(a=a+0.1 , b - 0.002, col="gray")
abline(a=a+0.1 , b - 0.002, col="gray")
abline(a=a+0.1 , b - 0.001, col="gray")
abline(a=a, b - 0.001, col="gray")
abline(a=a+0.5 , b , col="gray")
abline(a=a-0.5 , b , col="gray")

abline(lm(plasma~weight), col="red") # regression line

points(weight, plasma, pch=19)

#round(a,3)
#round(b,3)
```

The equation for the red line is:
$$Y_i=0.086 +  0.044 \cdot x_i \quad for \;i = 1 \dots 8$$ 
and in general: 
$$Y_i=\alpha + \beta \cdot x_i \quad for \; i = 1 \dots n$$ 

- In other words, by finding the best-fitting straight line we are **building a statistical model** to represent the relationship between plasma volume ($Y$) and explanatory body weight variable ($x$)
- If we were to use our model $Y_i=0.086 + 0.044 \cdot x_i$ to find plasma volume given a weight of 58 kg (our first observation, $i=1$), we would notice that we would get $Y=0.086 +  0.044 \cdot 58 = 2.638$, not exactly $2.75$ as we have for our first man in our dataset that we started with, i.e. $2.75 - 2.638 = 0.112 \neq 0$. 
- We thus add to the above equation an **error term** to account for this and now we can write our **simple regression model** more formally as:

\begin{equation}
Y_i=\alpha + \beta \cdot x_i + \epsilon_i
(\#eq:regression-linear)
\end{equation}

where:

- $x$: is called: exposure variable, explanatory variable, dependent variable, predictor, covariate
- $y$: is called: response, outcome, dependent variable
- $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are **model coefficients**
- and $\epsilon_i$ is an **error terms**


## Least squares
- in the above **"body weight - plasma volume"** example, the values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ have just appeared
- in practice, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ values are unknown and we use data to **estimate these coefficients**, noting the estimates with a **hat**, $\hat{\alpha}$ and $\hat{\beta}$
- **least squares** is one of the methods of parameters estimation, i.e. finding $\hat{\alpha}$ and $\hat{\beta}$

```{r regression-errors, echo=F, warning=F, message=F, fig.align="center", fig.width=4, fig.height=3, fig.cap="Scatter plot of the data shows that high plasma volume tends to be associated with high weight and *vice verca*. Linear regrssion gives the equation of the straight line (red) that best describes how the outcome changes with a change of exposure variable. Blue lines represent error terms, the vertical distances to the regression line"}

data.reg <- data.frame(plasma=plasma, weight=weight)
fit.reg <- lm(plasma~weight, data=data.reg)
data.reg$predicted <- predict(fit.reg)
data.reg$residuals <- residuals((fit.reg))

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data.reg, aes(x=data.reg$weight, data.reg$plasma)) + geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "firebrick") + 
  geom_segment(aes(xend = weight, yend = predicted), color="blue") + 
  geom_point(aes(y = predicted), shape = 1) +
  geom_point(aes(y = predicted), shape = 1) + 
  theme_bw() + xlab("body weight [kg]") + ylab("plasma volume [liters]") 

```


<br />  
Let $\hat{y_i}=\hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta}x_i$ be the prediction $y_i$ based on the $i$-th value of $x$:

- Then $\epsilon_i = y_i - \hat{y_i}$ represents the $i$-th **residual**, i.e. the difference between the $i$-th observed response value and the $i$-th response value that is predicted by the linear model
- RSS, the **residual sum of squares** is defined as: $$RSS = \epsilon_1^2 + \epsilon_2^2 + \dots + \epsilon_n^2$$ or
equivalently as: $$RSS=(y_1-\hat{\alpha}-\hat{\beta}x_1)^2+(y_2-\hat{\alpha}-\hat{\beta}x_2)^2+...+(y_n-\hat{\alpha}-\hat{\beta}x_n)^2$$
- the least squares approach chooses $\hat{\alpha}$ and $\hat{\beta}$ **to minimize the RSS**. With some calculus, [a good video explanation for the interested ones is here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewnc1cXJmGA), we get Theorem \@ref(thm:leastsq-01)

<br />  
```{theorem, name="Least squares estimates for a simple linear regression", label="leastsq-01"}

$$\hat{\beta} = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}}$$
$$\hat{\alpha} = \bar{y}-\frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}}\cdot \bar{x}$$
  
where:
  
- $\bar{x}$: mean value of $x$
- $\bar{y}$: mean value of $y$
- $S_{xx}$: sum of squares of $X$ defined as $S_{xx} = \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\bar{x})^2$
- $S_{yy}$: sum of squares of $Y$ defined as  $S_{yy} = \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-\bar{y})^2$
- $S_{xy}$: sum of products of $X$ and $Y$ defined as $S_{xy} = \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})$
  
```

<br />  
We can further re-write the above sum of squares to obtain

- sum of squares of $X$, $$S_{xx} = \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\bar{x})^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2-\frac{(\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i)^2}{n})$$
- sum of products of $X$ and $Y$

$$S_{xy} = \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})=\sum_{i=1}^nx_iy_i-\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_i}{n}$$

<br />  


**Example: Least squares**

Let's try least squares method to find coefficient estimates in the **"body weight and plasma volume example"**
```{r least-squares, collapse=TRUE}
# initial data
weight <- c(58, 70, 74, 63.5, 62.0, 70.5, 71.0, 66.0) # body weight (kg)
plasma <- c(2.75, 2.86, 3.37, 2.76, 2.62, 3.49, 3.05, 3.12) # plasma volume (liters)

# rename variables for convenience
x <- weight
y <- plasma

# mean values of x and y
x.bar <- mean(x)
y.bar <- mean(y)

# Sum of squares
Sxx <-  sum((x - x.bar)^2)
Sxy <- sum((x-x.bar)*(y-y.bar))

# Coefficient estimates
beta.hat <- Sxy / Sxx
alpha.hat <- y.bar - Sxy/Sxx*x.bar

# Print estimated coefficients alpha and beta
print(alpha.hat)

print(beta.hat)

```

In R we can use `lm`, the built-in function,  to fit a linear regression model and we can replace the above code with one line

```{r lm, collapse=TRUE}
lm(plasma ~ weight)
```

## Intercept and Slope
- Linear regression gives us estimates of model coefficient $Y_i = \alpha + \beta x_i + \epsilon_i$
- $\alpha$ is known as the **intercept**
- $\beta$ is known as the **slope**

```{r lm-parameters,  echo=F, fig.align="center", fig.height=7, fig.width=7, fig.cap="Scatter plot of the data shows that high plasma volume tends to be associated with high weight and *vice verca*. Linear regression gives the equation of the straight line that best describes how the outcome changes (increase or decreases) with a change of exposure variable (in red)", eval=T}

```

## Hypothesis testing

**Is there a relationship between the response and the predictor?**

- the calculated $\hat{\alpha}$ and $\hat{\beta}$ are **estimates of the population values** of the intercept and slope and are therefore subject to **sampling variation**
- their precision is measured by their **estimated standard errors**, `e.s.e`($\hat{\alpha}$) and `e.s.e`($\hat{\beta}$)
- these estimated standard errors are used in **hypothesis testing** and in constructing **confidence and prediction intervals**

**The most common hypothesis test** involves testing the ``null hypothesis`` of: 

- $H_0:$ There is no relationship between $X$ and $Y$ 
- versus the ``alternative hypothesis`` $H_a:$ there is some relationship between $X$ and $Y$

**Mathematically**, this corresponds to testing:

- $H_0: \beta=0$
- versus $H_a: \beta\neq0$
- since if $\beta=0$ then the model $Y_i=\alpha+\beta x_i + \epsilon_i$ reduces to $Y=\alpha + \epsilon_i$

**Under the null hypothesis** $H_0: \beta = 0$ 
<!-- we have: $$\frac{\hat{\beta}-\beta}{e.s.e(\hat{\beta})} \sim t(n-p)$$  -->
```{r, echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/linear-models/lm-tstatistics.png")
```

- $n$ is number of observations
- $p$ is number of model parameters
- $\frac{\hat{\beta}-\beta}{e.s.e(\hat{\beta})}$ is the ratio of the departure of the estimated value of a parameter, $\hat\beta$, from its hypothesized value, $\beta$, to its standard error, called `t-statistics`
- the `t-statistics` follows Student's t distribution with $n-p$ degrees of freedom

**Example: Hypothesis testing**

Let's look again at our example data. This time we will not only fit the linear regression model but look a bit more closely at the `R summary` of the model 
```{r lm-with-r, collapse=TRUE}
weight <- c(58, 70, 74, 63.5, 62.0, 70.5, 71.0, 66.0) # body weight (kg)
plasma <- c(2.75, 2.86, 3.37, 2.76, 2.62, 3.49, 3.05, 3.12) # plasma volume (liters)

model <- lm(plasma ~ weight)
print(summary(model))

```

- Under `Estimate` we see estimates of our model coefficients, $\hat{\alpha}$ (intercept) and $\hat{\beta}$ (slope, here weight), followed by their estimated standard errors, `Std. Errors`
- If we were to test if there is an **association between weight and plasma volume** we would write under the null hypothesis $H_0: \beta = 0$ $$\frac{\hat{\beta}-\beta}{e.s.e(\hat{\beta})} = \frac{0.04362-0}{0.01527} = 2.856582$$
- and we would **compare** `t-statistics` to `Student's t distribution` with $n-p = 8 - 2 = 6$ degrees of freedom (as we have 8 observations and two model parameters, $\alpha$ and $\beta$)
- we can use **Student's t distribution table** or **R code** to obtain the associated p-value
```{r t-student, collapse=TRUE}
2*pt(2.856582, df=6, lower=F)
```
- here the observed t-statistics is large and therefore yields a small p-value, meaning that **there is sufficient evidence to reject null hypothesis in favor of the alternative** and conclude that there is a significant association between weight and plasma volume

## Vector-matrix notations
While in simple linear regression it is feasible to arrive at the parameters estimates using calculus in more realistic settings of **multiple regression**, with more than one explanatory variable in the model, it is **more efficient to use vectors and matrices to define the regression model**. 

Let's **rewrite** our simple linear regression model $Y_i = \alpha + \beta_i + \epsilon_i \quad i=1,\dots n$ **into vector-matrix notation** in **6 steps**.

1. First we rename our $\alpha$ to $\beta_0$ and $\beta$ to $\beta_1$ as it is easier to keep tracking the number of model parameters this way
2. Then we notice that we actually have $n$ equations such as:
$$y_1 = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \epsilon_1$$
$$y_2 = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_2 + \epsilon_2$$
$$y_3 = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_3 + \epsilon_3$$
$$\dots$$
$$y_n = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_n + \epsilon_n$$
3. We group all $Y_i$ and $\epsilon_i$ into column vectors: 
$\mathbf{Y}=\begin{bmatrix}
  y_1  \\
  y_2    \\
  \vdots \\
  y_{n}
\end{bmatrix}$ and 
$\boldsymbol\epsilon=\begin{bmatrix}
  \epsilon_1  \\
  \epsilon_2    \\
  \vdots \\
  \epsilon_{n}
\end{bmatrix}$

4. We stack two parameters $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ into another column vector:$$\boldsymbol\beta=\begin{bmatrix}
  \beta_0  \\
  \beta_1
\end{bmatrix}$$
5. We append a vector of ones with the single predictor for each $i$ and create a matrix with two columns called **design matrix** $$\mathbf{X}=\begin{bmatrix}
  1 & x_1  \\
  1 & x_2  \\
  \vdots & \vdots \\
  1 & x_{n}
\end{bmatrix}$$

6. We write our linear model in a vector-matrix notations as: 
$$\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol\beta + \boldsymbol\epsilon$$

**Definition: vector matrix form of the linear model**

The vector-matrix representation of a linear model with $p-1$ predictors can be written as 
$$\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol\beta + \boldsymbol\epsilon$$

where:

- $\mathbf{Y}$ is $n \times1$ vector of observations
- $\mathbf{X}$ is $n \times p$ **design matrix**
- $\boldsymbol\beta$ is $p \times1$ vector of parameters
- $\boldsymbol\epsilon$ is $n \times1$ vector of vector of random errors, indepedent and identically distributed (i.i.d) N(0, $\sigma^2$)

In full, the above vectors and matrix have the form:

$\mathbf{Y}=\begin{bmatrix}
  y_1  \\
  y_2    \\
  \vdots \\
  y_{n}
\end{bmatrix}$ 
$\boldsymbol\beta=\begin{bmatrix}
  \beta_0  \\
  \beta_1    \\
  \vdots \\
  \beta_{p}
\end{bmatrix}$
$\boldsymbol\epsilon=\begin{bmatrix}
  \epsilon_1  \\
  \epsilon_2    \\
  \vdots \\
  \epsilon_{n}
\end{bmatrix}$
$\mathbf{X}=\begin{bmatrix}
  1 & x_{1,1} & \dots & x_{1,p-1} \\
  1 & x_{2,1} & \dots & x_{2,p-1} \\
  \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
  1 & x_{n,1} & \dots & x_{n,p-1} 
\end{bmatrix}$


<br />  
```{theorem, name="Least squares in vector-matrix notation", label="leastsq-02"}


The least squares estimates for a linear regression of the form:
$$\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol\beta + \boldsymbol\epsilon$$

is given by: 
$$\hat{\mathbf{\beta}}= (\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{Y}$$
```
  
**Example: vector-matrix notation**

Following the above definition we can write the **"weight - plasma volume model"** as: 
$$\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol\beta + \boldsymbol\epsilon$$
where:

$\mathbf{Y}=\begin{bmatrix}
 2.75  \\ 2.86 \\ 3.37 \\ 2.76 \\ 2.62 \\ 3.49 \\ 3.05 \\ 3.12
\end{bmatrix}$ 

$\boldsymbol\beta=\begin{bmatrix}
  \beta_0  \\
  \beta_1 
\end{bmatrix}$
$\boldsymbol\epsilon=\begin{bmatrix}
  \epsilon_1  \\
  \epsilon_2    \\
  \vdots \\
  \epsilon_{8}
\end{bmatrix}$
$\mathbf{X}=\begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 58.0 \\
  1 & 70.0 \\
  1 & 74.0 \\
  1 & 63.5 \\
  1 & 62.0 \\
  1 & 70.5 \\
  1 & 71.0 \\
  1 & 66.0 \\
\end{bmatrix}$

and we can estimate model parameters using $\hat{\mathbf{\beta}}= (\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{Y}$. We can do it by hand or in `R` as follows:
```{r lse-matrix, collapse=TRUE}
n <- length(plasma) # no. of observation
Y <- as.matrix(plasma, ncol=1)
X <- cbind(rep(1, length=n), weight)
X <- as.matrix(X)

# print Y and X to double-check that the format is according to the definition
print(Y) 
print(X) 

# least squares estimate
# solve() finds inverse of matrix
beta.hat <- solve(t(X)%*%X)%*%t(X)%*%Y 
print(beta.hat)

```

## Confidence intervals and prediction intervals
- when we estimate coefficients we can also find their **confidence intervals**, typically 95\% confidence intervals, i.e. a range of values that contain the true unknown value of the parameter
- we can also use linear regression models to predict the response value given a new observation and find **prediction intervals**. Here, we look at any specific value of $x_i$, and find an interval around the predicted value $y_i'$ for $x_i$ such that there is a 95\% probability that the real value of y (in the population) corresponding to $x_i$ is within this interval


<!-- Earlier we said that we use estimated standard error in hypothesis testing and in finding the intervals but we have not yet said how to calculate e.s.e. Using vector-matrix notation we can now write that: -->
<!-- $$\frac{(\mathbf{b}\hat{{\boldsymbol\beta}}-\mathbf{b}^T\boldsymbol\beta)}{\sqrt{\frac{RSS}{n-p}\mathbf{b^T(X^TX)^{-1}b}}}$$ -->

<!-- where: -->

<!-- - the denominator would yield e.s.e($\beta_1$) if $\mathbf{b^T}=(0 \quad 1)$ and a model $Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x + \epsilon_i$ -->
<!-- - a **confidence interval estimate** for $\beta_1$ could be estimated via:  -->
<!-- $$\mathbf{b^T}\hat{\boldsymbol\beta} \pm t(n-p; \frac{1+c}{2})\sqrt{\frac{RSS}{n-p}(\mathbf{b^T}(\mathbf{X^T}\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{b})}$$ -->

<!-- - and a **prediction interval** with confidence $c$ is -->
<!-- $$\mathbf{b^T}\hat{\boldsymbol\beta} \pm t(n-p; \frac{1+c}{2})\sqrt{(\frac{RSS}{n-p}(1+\mathbf{b^T}(\mathbf{X^T}\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{b}})$$ -->

<!-- We will not go further into these calculations here but use `R functions` to obtain these -->

<!-- - just remember that the **prediction interval is always wider than the confidence interval** -->
<!-- - note (1 + ) in the prediction interval equation -->

**Example: prediction and intervals**

Let's: 

- find confidence intervals for our coefficient estimates
- predict plasma volume for a men weighting 60 kg
- find prediction interval
- plot original data, fitted regression model, predicted observation and prediction interval

```{r predict, collapse=TRUE}
# fit regression model
model <- lm(plasma ~ weight)
print(summary(model))

# find confidence intervals for the model coefficients
confint(model)

# predict plasma volume for a new observation of 60 kg
# we have to create data frame with a variable name matching the one used to build the model 
new.obs <- data.frame(weight = 60)  
predict(model, newdata = new.obs) 

# find prediction intervals
prediction.interval <- predict(model, newdata = new.obs,  interval = "prediction")
print(prediction.interval)

# plot the original data, fitted regression and predicted value
plot(weight, plasma, pch=19, xlab="weight [kg]", ylab="plasma [l]", ylim=c(2,4))
lines(weight, model$fitted.values, col="red") # fitted model in red
points(new.obs, predict(model, newdata = new.obs), pch=19, col="blue") # predicted value at 60kg
segments(60, prediction.interval[2], 60, prediction.interval[3], lty = 3) # add prediciton interval

```{exercise, "lm-protein"}
Protein levels in pregnancy

The researchers were interested whether protein levels in expectant mothers are changing throughout the pregnancy. Observations have been taken on 19 healthy women and each woman was at different stage of pregnancy (gestation).

Assuming linear model: 

- $Y_i = \alpha + \beta x_i + \epsilon_i$, where $Y_i$ corresponds to protein levels in i-th observation

and taking summary statisitcs:

- $\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i = 456$
- $\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2 = 12164$
- $\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_iy_i = 369.87$
- $\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_i = 14.25$
- $\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_i^2 = 11.55$
  
  
a) find the least square estimates of $\hat{\alpha}$ and $\hat{\beta}$
b) knowing that e.s.e($\hat{\beta}) = 0.003295$
  
can we:
  
- i) reject the null hypothesis that the is no relationship between protein level and gestation, i.e. perform a hypothesis test to test $H_0:\beta = 0$; 
- ii) can we reject the null hypothesis that $\beta = 0.02$, i.e.  perform a hypothesis test to test $H_0:\beta = 0.02$
c) write down the linear model in the vector-matrix notation and identify response, parameter, design and error matrices
d) read in "protein.csv" data into R, set Y as protein (response) and calculate using matrix functions the least squares estimates of model coefficients
e) use `lm()` function in R to check your calculations
f) use the fitted model in R to predict the value of protein levels at week 20. Try plotting the data, fitted linear model and the predicted value to assess whether your prediction is to be expected.

```{exercise, "lm-potato"}

The glucose level in potatoes depends on their storage time and the relationship is somehow curvilinear as shown below.
As we believe that the quadratic function might describe the relationship, assume linear model in form 
$Y_i = \alpha + \beta x_i + \gamma x_i^2 + \epsilon_i \quad i=1,\dots,n$ where $n=14$ and

a) write down the model in vector-matrix notation
b) load data from "potatoes.csv" and use least squares estimates to obtain estimates of model coefficients
c) use `lm()` function to verify your calculations
d) perform a hypothesis test to test $H_0:\gamma=0$; and comment whether there is a significant quadratic relationship
e) predict glucose concentration at storage time 4 and 16 weeks. Plot the data, the fitted model and the predicted values

```

```{r potatoes, collapse=TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Sugar in potatoes: relationship between storage time and glucose content", fig.width=5, fig.height=4, echo=F}

## Answers to selected exercises (linear models) {-}

Exr. \@ref(exr:lm-protein)

a)

- $S_{xx} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2-\frac{(\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i)^2}{n} = 12164 - \frac{456^2}{19} = 1220$
- $S_{xy} = \sum_{i=1}^nx_iy_i-\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_i}{n} = 369.87 - \frac{(456 \cdot 14.25)}{19} = 27.87$
- $\hat{\beta} = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}} = 27.87 / 1220 = 0.02284$
- $\hat{\alpha} = \bar{y}-\frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}}\cdot \bar{x} = \frac{14.25}{19}-\frac{27.87}{1220}\cdot \frac{456}{19} = 0.20174$

b) i.

We can calculate test statistics following:

- $\frac{\hat{\beta} - \beta}{e.s.e(\hat{\beta})} \sim t(n-p) = \frac{0.02284 - 0}{0.003295} = 6.934$ where the value follows Student's t distribution with $n-p = 19 - 2 = 17$ degrees of freedom. We can now estimate the a p-value using Student’s t distribution table or use R function
```{r, collapse=TRUE}
2*pt(6.934, df=17, lower=F)
```
As p-value << 0.001 there is sufficient evidence to reject $H_0$ in favor of $H_1$, thus we can conclude that there is a significant relationship between protein levels and gestation 

b) ii.

Similarly, we can test $H_0:\beta = 0.02$, i.e. $\frac{\hat{\beta} - \beta}{e.s.e(\hat{\beta})} \sim t(n-p) = \frac{0.02284 - 0.02}{0.20174} = 0.01407753$. Now the test statistics is small 
```{r t-student-02, collapse=TRUE}
2*pt(0.01407753, df=17, lower=F)
```
p-value is large and hence there is no sufficient evidence to reject $H_0$ and we can conclude that $\beta = 0.02$

c) We can rewrite the linear model in vector-matrix formation as $\mathbf{Y}= \mathbf{\beta}\mathbf{X} + \mathbf{\epsilon}$ where:

response $\mathbf{Y}=\begin{bmatrix}
  y_1  \\
  y_2    \\
  \vdots \\
  y_{19}
\end{bmatrix}$

parameters $\boldsymbol\beta=\begin{bmatrix}
  \alpha \\
  \beta
\end{bmatrix}$

design matrix $\mathbf{X}=\begin{bmatrix}
  1 & x_1  \\
  1 & x_2  \\
  \vdots & \vdots \\
  1 & x_{19}
\end{bmatrix}$

errors $\boldsymbol\epsilon=\begin{bmatrix}
  \epsilon_1  \\
  \epsilon_2    \\
  \vdots \\
  \epsilon_{19}
\end{bmatrix}$

d) The least squares estimates in vector-matrix notation is $\hat{\boldsymbol\beta}= (\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{Y}$ and we can calculate this in R

```{r protein, collapse=TRUE}
# read in data 
data.protein <- read.csv("data/lm/protein.csv")

# print out top observations
head(data.protein)

# define Y and X matrices given the data
n <- nrow(data.protein) # nu. of observations
Y <-  as.matrix(data.protein$Protein, ncol=1) # response 
X <-  as.matrix(cbind(rep(1, length=n), data.protein$Gestation)) # design matrix
head(X) # double check that the design matrix looks like it should

# least squares estimate
beta.hat <- solve(t(X)%*%X)%*%t(X)%*%Y # beta.hat is a matrix that contains our alpha and beta in the model
print(beta.hat)

```

e) We use `lm()` function to check our calculations
```{r protein-lm, collapse=TRUE}
# fit linear regression model and print model summary
protein <- data.protein$Protein # our Y
gestation <- data.protein$Gestation # our X

model <- lm(protein ~ gestation)
print(summary(model))

```

f) 
```{r protein-predict}
new.obs <- data.frame(gestation = 20)
y.pred <- predict(model, newdata = new.obs)

# we can visualize the data, fitted linear model (red), and the predicted value (blue)
plot(gestation, protein, pch=19, xlab="gestation [weeks]", ylab="protein levels [mgml-1]")
lines(gestation, model$fitted.values, col="red")
points(new.obs, y.pred, col="blue", pch=19, cex = 1)

```

a) We can rewrite the linear model in vector-matrix formation as $$\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol\beta + \boldsymbol\epsilon$$

where:
response $\mathbf{Y}=\begin{bmatrix}
  y_1  \\
  y_2    \\
  \vdots \\
  y_{14}
\end{bmatrix}$

parameters $\boldsymbol\beta=\begin{bmatrix}
  \alpha \\
  \beta \\
  \gamma
\end{bmatrix}$

design matrix $\mathbf{X}=\begin{bmatrix}
  1 & x_1  & x_1^2\\
  1 & x_2  & x_2^2\\
  \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
  1 & x_{14} & x_{14}^2
\end{bmatrix}$

errors $\boldsymbol\epsilon=\begin{bmatrix}
  \epsilon_1  \\
  \epsilon_2    \\
  \vdots \\
  \epsilon_{14}
\end{bmatrix}$


b) load data to from "potatoes.csv" and use least squares estimates for obtain estimates of model coefficients
```{r potoate-lse, collapse=TRUE}
data.potatoes <- read.csv("data/lm/potatoes.csv")

# define matrices
n <- nrow(data.potatoes)
Y <-  data.potatoes$Glucose
X1 <- data.potatoes$Weeks
X2 <- (data.potatoes$Weeks)^2
X <- cbind(rep(1, length(n)), X1, X2)
X <- as.matrix(X)

# least squares estimate
# beta here refers to the matrix of model coefficients incl. alpha, beta and gamma
beta.hat <- solve(t(X)%*%X)%*%t(X)%*%Y 
print(beta.hat)
```

c) we use `lm()` function to verify our calculations:
```{r potato-lm}
model <- lm(Y ~ X1 + X2)
print(summary(model))
```
d) perform a hypothesis test to test $H_0:\gamma=0$; and comment whether we there is a significant quadratic term
- $\frac{\hat{\gamma} - \gamma}{e.s.e(\hat{\gamma})} \sim t(n-p) = \frac{1.030423 - 0}{0.1406} = 7.328755$ where the value follows Student's t distribution with $n-p = 19 - 2 = 17$ degrees of freedom. We can now estimate the a p-value using Student’s t distribution table or use a function in R
```{r, collapse=TRUE}
2*pt(7.328755, df=14-3, lower=F)
```
As p-value << 0.001 there is sufficient evidence to reject $H_0$ in favor of $H_1$, thus we can conclude that there is a significant quadratic relationship between glucose and storage time 

e) predict glucose concentration at storage time 4 and 16 weeks
```{r potato-predict}
new.obs <- data.frame(X1 = c(4, 16), X2 = c(4^2, 16^2))
pred.y <- predict(model, newdata = new.obs)

plot(data.potatoes$Weeks, data.potatoes$Glucose, xlab="Storage time [weeks]", ylab="Glucose [g/kg]", pch=19)
lines(data.potatoes$Weeks, model$fitted.values, col="red")
points(new.obs[,1], pred.y, pch=19, col="blue")

```
