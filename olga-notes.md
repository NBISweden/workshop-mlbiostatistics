# ToDo

## Welcome

- add explanation about chapters v.s presentations
- add note about lunches

## Descriptive statistics

- check if code is available
- add gtsummary() examples

  - add explanation about chapters vs. presentations, tips on how to have it in R: summary: gtsummary() 

- Probability: add potential group exercises: log-normal, normal, binomial, negative binomial, omits: guess what is the distribution and what omics it comes from?
- Probability: add a note about transformations, scaling, normalisation
- Remove non-parametric session, move the correlation back to main on Tuesday main or Wednesday, add link to chapter.
- Tuesday competition: simulated data, find DEGs, log it, t-test, confidence intervals and/or demonstration
- Check quizzes for Tuesday after removing non-parametric session.
- Linear: remove what linear models are and are not? Missing plus, and indices; change term to least-squares models?
- Linear: checking assumptions plots from lm() method, maybe focus more on that, explain Cookâ€™s distance; add more examples, correlated measurements.
- Splitting presentation: checking assumptions, logistics regressions into two entries under Schedule 
- Linear: bring the same challenge from Tuesday but add age now
- Feature engineering & selection: check tidymodels
- Move intro to supervised to Wednesday morning, finish linear models with supervised example
- Thursday afternoon: feature selection, expand Lasso, logistic-Lasso; Friday more practical example with tidymodels, maybe not with tidymodels.
