How to summarize and analyze your data depends on the type. Categorical data types are divided into; Nominal: named. Ex: dead/alive, healthy/sick, WT/mutant, AA/Aa/aa, male/female, red/green/blue Ordinal: named and ordered. Ex: pain (weak, moderate, severe), AA/Aa/aa, very young/young/middle age/old/very old, grade I, II, III, IV Quantitative data types are divided into; Discrete: finite or countable infinite values. Ex. counts, number of cells, number of reads Continuous: infinitely many uncountable values. Ex. height, weight, concentration 2.2 Categorical data 2.2.1 Data summarization and plots Categorical data can be summarized by counting the number of observations of each category and summarizing in a frequency table or bar plot. Alternatively, the proportions (or percentages) of each category can be calculated. Example 2.1 Ten lab mice Observe gender and weight of your ten lab mice and summarize. If you want to follow this example, you can download the data here; mice.csv. You get the subset used in this example by the following commands; ## first read the full data set into R mice &lt;- read.csv(&quot;mice.csv&quot;) ## Then extract the specific subset used in this example m10 &lt;- subset(mice, subset=week==5 &amp; id %in% 1:10, select = c(id, gender, weight)) In this example we have only ten observations (mice) and the full data can actually be shown in a table. Table 2.1: Gender and weight of 10 mice. id gender weight 1 1 male 19 21 2 male 21 41 3 female 18 61 4 male 20 81 5 male 21 101 6 male 17 121 7 female 18 141 8 male 24 161 9 male 22 181 10 female 18 We are interested in the gender distribution in our group of mice. Count the frequency of male/female mice and summarize in a table. Also, the fraction or percentage can be useful. Table 2.2: The number of male and female mice. gender n percent (%) female 3 30 male 7 70 The frequencies can also be shown in a barplot. ggplot(m10, aes(x=gender)) + geom_bar() barplot(table(m10$gender)) Figure 2.1: The number of male and female mice shown in barplots generated using ggplot and basic R graphics. Example 2.2 \\iffalse (Left handedness) You are interested in whether left-handedness is associated to a disease you study and observe left-handedness among 30 patients as well as among 40 healthy controls; patients: {L, L, L, R, L, R, R, L, L, R, R, R, R, R, L, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, L, L, R, R, R} controls: {R, L, R, R, L, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, L, R, R, L, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R} Summarized as Table 2.3: Summary of left handedness among patients and controls. group Total n Left handed (%) control 40 4 (10%) patient 30 9 (30%) or in a contingency table; Table 2.4: Cross table or contingency table of group and left/right handedness.

Repeat the experiment 1000 times. This histogram summarize the results, i.e. the total number of dots when throwing 10 dice. or a density plot; Figure 2.4: Density plot over the total number of dots when throwing 10 dice. Figure 2.5: Histogram over weight of 2000 5 weeks old mice, colored according to gender. Summary statistics for numeric data are usually divided into measures of location and spread. 2.4 Measures of location Mode: the most common value, can be computed also for categorical data Median: The value that divide the ordered data values into two equally sized groups. 50% of the values are below the median. Mean: the arithmetic mean, also called the average For \\(n\\) onservations \\(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n\\), the mean value is calculated as; \\[\\bar x = \\frac{x_1+x_2+\\dots+x_n}{n} = \\frac{1}{n}\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\\] Note, several very different distributions can still have the same mean value. Figure 2.6: All these distributions have the same mean value, 3.50. 2.5 Measures of spread Quartiles - the three values that divide the data values into four equally sized groups. Q1. First quartile. 25% of the values are below Q1. Divides the values below the median into equally sized groups. Q2.´ Second quartile. 50% of the values are below Q2. Q2 is the median. Q3. Third quartile. 75% of the values are below Q3. Divides the values above the median into equally sized groups. IQR: interquartile range: Q3 - Q1 Variance, \\(\\sigma^2\\). The variance is the mean squared distance from the mean value. Standard deviation, \\(\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\sigma^2}\\). 2.5.1 Variance and standard deviation The variance of a set of observations is their mean squared distance from the mean value; \\[\\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar x)^2.\\] the variance is measured in the square of the unit in which \\(x\\) was measured. a commonly used measured on the same unit as \\(x\\) is the standard deviation, defined as the square root of the variance; \\[\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar x)^2}\\] The denominator \\(n\\) is commonly replaced by \\(n-1\\) and the sample standard deviation is calculated instead; \\[s = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar x)^2}.\\] The latter formula is used if we regard the collection of observations \\(x_1, \\dots, x_n\\) as a sample drawn from a large population of possible observations. I we want to describe the variance/standard deviation only of our set of observations, the former formula should be used, calculation of a population standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) (i.e. we consider the set of observations to be the full population). If instead, we want to estimate the variance of a larger population from which our smaller sample is drawn, we should calculate the sample standard deviation, \\(s\\).

Compare: the chance of the sun rising tomorrow with the chance that no-one is infected with COVID-19 tomorrow the chance of a cold dark winter in Stockholm with the chance of no rainy days over the summer months in Stockholm We intuitively believe that the chance of sun rising or dark winter occurring are enormously higher than COVID-19 disappearing over night or having no rain over the entire summer. Probability gives us a scale for measuring the likeliness of events to occur. Probability rules enable us to reason about uncertain events. The probability rules are expressed in terms of sets, a well-defined collection of distinct objects. Suppose we perform an experiment that we do not know the outcome of, i.e. we are uncertain about the outcome. We can however list all the outcomes that might occur. sample space is the set \\(S\\) of these possible outcomes of the experiment, e.g. getting 1, 2 etc. on the 6-sided dice \\(S=\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\) an event is a subset of the sample space an event is said to occur if the outcome of the experiment belong to this set The complement, \\(E&#39;\\), of the event \\(E\\) contains all the outcomes in \\(S\\) which are not in \\(E\\) Two sets \\(E\\) and \\(F\\), such that \\(E \\cap F = \\emptyset\\), are said to be disjoint 3.1.1 Axioms of probability \\(0 \\leq P(E) \\leq 1\\) for any event \\(E \\subseteq S\\) \\(P(S) = 1\\) if \\(E\\), \\(F\\) are disjoint events, then \\(P(E \\cup F) = P(E) + P(F)\\) 3.1.2 Common rules of probability Based on the axioms the following rules of probability can be proved. Complement rule: let \\(E \\subseteq S\\) be any event, then \\(P(E&#39;) = 1 - P(E)\\) Impossible event: \\(P(\\emptyset)=0\\) Probability of a subset: let \\(E,F \\subseteq S\\) be events such that \\(E \\subseteq F\\) then \\(P(F) \\geq P(E)\\) Addition rule: let \\(E,F \\subseteq S\\) be any two events, then \\(P(E \\cup F) = P(E) + P(F) - P(E \\cap F)\\) 3.1.3 Conditional probability Let \\(E,F \\subseteq S\\) be two events that \\(P(E)&gt;0\\) then the conditional probability of \\(F\\) given that \\(E\\) occurs is defined to be: \\[P(F|E) = \\frac{P(E\\cap F)}{P(E)}\\] Product rule follows conditional probability: let \\(E,F \\subseteq S\\) be events such that \\(P(E)&gt;0\\) then: \\[P(E \\cap F) = P(F|E)P(E) = P(E|F)P(F)\\] 3.1.4 The urn model The urn model is a simple model commonly used in statistics and probability. In the urn model, real objects (such as people, mice, cells, genes, molecules, etc) are represented by balls of different colors. A fair coin can be represented by an urn with two balls representing the coins two sides. A group of people can be modelled in an urn model, if age is the variable of interest, we write the age of each person on the balls. If we instead are interested in if the people are allergic to pollen or not, we color the balls according to allergy status. Figure 3.1: Urn models of a fair coin, age of a group of people, pollen allergy status of a group of people. In the urn model every unit (ball) is equally likely of being selected. This means that the urn model us well suited to represent flipping a fair coin. However, a biased coin can also be modelled using an urn model, by changing the number of balls that represent each side of the coin. By drawing balls from the urn with (or without) replacement, probabilities and other properties of the model can be inferred. 3.1.5 Random variables The outcome of a random experiment can be described by a random variable. Whenever chance is involved in the outcome of an experiment the outcome is a random variable. A random variable can not be predicted exactly, but the probability of all possible outcomes can be described. The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of a random variable. Note, the sample space is not always countable. A random variable is usually denoted by a capital letter, \\(X, Y, Z, \\dots\\). Values collected in an experiment are observations of the random variable, usually denoted by lowercase letters \\(x, y, z, \\dots\\). The population is the collection of all units studied. A sample is a subset of the population. Example random variables and probabilites: The weight of a random newborn baby, \\(W\\). \\(P(W&gt;4.0kg)\\) The smoking status of a random mother, \\(S\\). \\(P(S=1)\\) The hemoglobin concentration in blood, \\(Hb\\). \\(P(Hb&lt;125 g/L)\\) The number of mutations in a gene BMI of a random man Weight status of a random man (underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese) The result of throwing a die Conditional probability can be written for example \\(P(W \\geq 3.5 | S = 1)\\), which is the probability that \\(X \\geq 3.5\\) if \\(S = 1\\), in words “the probability that a smoking mother has a baby with birth weight of 3.5 kg or more”. 3.2 Discrete random variables A discrete random number has countable number of outcome values, such as {1,2,3,4,5,6}; {red, blue, green}; {tiny, small, average, large, huge} or all integers. A discrete random variable can be described by its probability mass function, pmf. The probability that the random variable, \\(X\\), takes the value \\(x\\) is denoted \\(P(X=x) = p(x)\\). Note that: \\(0 \\leq p(x) \\leq 1\\), a probability is always between 0 and 1. \\(\\sum p(x) = 1\\), the sum over all possible outcomes is 1. Example 3.1 The number of dots on a die When rolling a die the there are six possible outcomes; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, each of which have the same probability, if the die is fair. The outcome of one dice roll can be described by a random variable \\(X\\). The probability of a particular outcome \\(x\\) is denoted \\(P(X=x)\\) or \\(p(x)\\). The probability mass function of a fair six-sided die can be summarized in a table; x 1.00 2.00 3.00 4.00 5.00 6.00 p(x) 0.17 0.17 0.17 0.17 0.17 0.17 or in a barplot; Figure 3.2: Probability mass function of a die. non-smoker smoker x 0 1 p(x) 0.61 0.39 Example 3.2 CFU The number of bacterial colonies on a plate is a random number. Figure 3.3: Probability mass distribution of the number of bacterial colonies on an agar plate. 3.2.1 Expected value When the probability mass function is know the expected value of the random variable can be computed. \\[E[X] = \\mu = \\sum_{i=1}^N x_i p(x_i)\\] For a uniform distribution, where every object has the same probability (in the urn model, every object is represented by one ball), the expected value can be computed as the sum of all objects divided by the total number of objects; \\[E[X] = \\mu = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N x_i\\] Linear transformations and combinations \\[E(aX) = a E(X)\\] \\[E(X + Y) = E(X) + E(Y)\\] \\[E[aX + bY] = aE[X] + bE[Y]\\] 3.2.2 Variance The variance is a measure of spread and is defined as the expected value of the squared distance from the expected value; \\[var(X) = \\sigma^2 = E[(X-\\mu)^2] = \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\\mu)^2 p(x_i)\\] Linear transformations and combinations \\[var(aX) = a^2 var(X)\\] For independent random variables X and Y \\[var(aX + bY) = a^2var(X) + b^2var(Y)\\] 3.2.3 Simulate distributions Once the distribution is known, we can compute probabilities, such as \\(P(X=x), P(X&lt;x)\\) and \\(P(X \\geq x)\\). If the distribution is not known, simulation might be the solution. Example 3.3 Simulate coin toss In a single coin toss the probabity of heads is 0.5. In 20 coin tosses, what is the probability of at least 15 heads? The outcome of a single coin toss is a random variable, \\(X\\) with two possible outcomes \\(\\{H, T\\}\\). We know that \\(P(X=H) = 0.5\\). The random variable of interest is the number of heads in 20 coin tosses, \\(Y\\). The probability that we need to compute is \\(P(Y \\geq 15)\\). Figure 3.4: A coin toss. Urn model with one black ball (heads) and one white ball (tails). A single coin toss can be modelled by an urn with two balls. When a ball is drawn randomly from the urn, the probability to get the black ball (heads) is \\(P(X=H) = 0.5\\). If we want to simulate tossing 20 coins (or one coin 20 times) we can use the same urn model, if the ball is replaced after each draw. In R we can simulate random draws from an urn model using the function sample. # A single coin toss sample(c(&quot;H&quot;, &quot;T&quot;), size=1) ## [1] &quot;H&quot; # Another coin toss sample(c(&quot;H&quot;, &quot;T&quot;), size=1) ## [1] &quot;H&quot; Every time you run sample a new coin toss is simulated. The argument size tells the function how many balls we want to draw from the urn. To draw 20 balls from the urn, set size=20, remember to replace the ball after each draw! # 20 independent coin tosses (coins &lt;- sample(c(&quot;H&quot;, &quot;T&quot;), size=20, replace=TRUE)) ## [1] &quot;H&quot; &quot;H&quot; &quot;H&quot; &quot;H&quot; &quot;T&quot; &quot;H&quot; &quot;H&quot; &quot;T&quot; &quot;T&quot; &quot;T&quot; &quot;H&quot; &quot;T&quot; &quot;H&quot; &quot;H&quot; &quot;T&quot; &quot;H&quot; &quot;T&quot; &quot;T&quot; &quot;T&quot; ## [20] &quot;T&quot; How many heads did we get in the 20 random draws? # How many heads? sum(coins == &quot;H&quot;) ## [1] 10 We can repeat this experiment (toss 20 coins and count the number of heads) several times to estimate the distribution of number of heads in 20 coin tosses. To do the same thing several times we use the function replicate. To simulate tossing 20 coins and counting the number of heads 10000 times, do the following; Nheads &lt;- replicate(10000, { coins &lt;- sample(c(&quot;H&quot;, &quot;T&quot;), size=20, replace=TRUE) sum(coins == &quot;H&quot;) }) Plot distribution of the number of heads in a histogram. hist(Nheads, breaks=0:20-0.5) Now, let’s get back to the question; when tossing 20 coins, what is the probability of at least 15 heads? \\(P(X \\geq 15)\\) Count how many times out of our 10000 exeriments the number is 15 or greater sum(Nheads &gt;= 15) ## [1] 200 From this we conclude that \\(P(X \\geq 15) =\\) 200/10000 = 0.02 3.2.4 Parametric discrete distributions 3.2.4.1 Bernoulli trial A Bernoulli trial is a random experiment with two outcomes; success and failure. The probability of success, \\(P(success) = p\\), is constant. The probability of failure is \\(P(failure) = 1-p\\). When coding it is convenient to code success as 1 and failure as 0. The outcome of a Bernoulli trial is a discrete random variable, \\(X\\). \\[p(x) = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} p &amp; \\mathrm{if}\\,x=1\\mathrm,\\,success\\\\ 1-p &amp; \\mathrm{if}\\,x=0\\mathrm,\\,failure \\end{array} \\right.\\] Using the definitions of expected value and variance it can be shown that; \\[E[X] = p\\\\ var(X) = p(1-p)\\] 3.2.4.2 Binomial distribution The number of successes in a series of independent and identical Bernoulli trials is a discrete random variable, \\(X\\). \\(X = \\sum_{i=0}^n Z_i,\\) where all \\(Z_i\\) describe the outcome of independent and identical Bernoilli trials with probability \\(p\\) for success (\\(P(Z_i=1) = p\\)). The probability mass function of \\(X\\) is called the binomial distribution. In short we use the notation; \\[X \\in Bin(n, p)\\] The probability mass function is \\[P(X=k) = {n \\choose k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}\\] It can be shown that \\[E[X] = np\\\\ var(X) = np(1-p)\\] The binomial distribution occurs when sampling \\(n\\) objects with replacement from an urn with objects of two types, of which the interesting type has probability \\(p\\). The probability mass function, \\(P(X=k)\\) can be computed using the R function dbinom and the cumulative distribution function \\(P(X \\leq k)\\) can be computed using pbinom. 3.2.4.3 Hypergeometric distribution The hypergeometric distribution occurs when sampling \\(n\\) objects without replacement from an urn with \\(N\\) objects of two types, of which the interesting type has probability \\(p\\). The probability density function \\[P(X=k) = \\frac{{Np \\choose x} {N-Np \\choose n-x}}{N \\choose n}\\] can be computed in R using dhyper and the cumulative distribution function \\(P(X \\leq k)\\) can be computed using phyper. 3.2.4.4 Poisson distribution The Poisson distribution describe the number of times a rare event occurs in a large number of trials. A rare disease has a very low probability for a single individual. The number of individuals in a large population that catch the disease in a certain time period can be modelled using the Poisson distribution. The probability mass function; \\[P(X=k) = \\frac{\\mu}{k!}e^{-\\mu},\\] where \\(\\mu\\) is the expected value, which is \\(\\mu = n \\pi\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of objects sampled from the population and \\(\\pi\\) is the probability of a single object. The Poisson distribution can approximate the binomial distribution if \\(n\\) is large (\\(n&gt;10\\)) and \\(\\pi\\) is small (\\(\\pi &lt; 0.1\\)). 3.2.4.5 Distributions in R Probability mass functions, \\(P(X=x)\\), for the binomial, hypergeometric and Poisson distributions can in R can be computed using functions dbinom, dhyper, and dpois, respectively. Cumulative distribution functions, \\(P(X \\leq x)\\) can be computed using pbinom, phyper and ppois. Also, functions for computing an \\(x\\) such that \\(P(X \\leq x) = q\\), where \\(q\\) is a probability of interest are available using qbinom, qhyper, and qpois.

Examples: weight, height, speed, intensity, … A continuous random variable can be described by its probability density function, pdf. Figure 3.5: Probability density function of the weight of a newborn baby. The probability density function, \\(f(x)\\), is defined such that the total area under the curve is 1. \\[ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) dx = 1 \\] The area under the curve from a to b is the probability that the random variable \\(X\\) takes a value between a and b. \\(P(a \\leq X \\leq b) = \\int_a^b f(x) dx\\) The cumulative distribution function, cdf, sometimes called just the distribution function, \\(F(x)\\), is defined as: \\[F(x) = P(X \\leq x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^x f(x) dx\\] \\[P(X \\leq x) = F(x)\\] As we know that the total probability (over all x) is 1, we can conclude that \\[P(X &gt; x) = 1 - F(x)\\] and thus \\[P(a &lt; X \\leq b) = F(b) - F(a)\\] 3.3.1 Parametric continuous distributions Two important parameters of a distribution is the expected value, \\(\\mu\\), that describe the distributions location and the variance, \\(\\sigma^2\\), that describe the spread. The expected value, or population mean, is defined as; \\[E[X] = \\mu = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty x f(x) dx\\] We will learn more about the expected value and how to estimate a population mean from a sample later in the course. The variance is defined as the expected value of the squared distance from the population mean; \\[\\sigma^2 = E[(X-\\mu)^2] = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty (x-\\mu)^2 f(x) dx\\] The square root of the variance is called the standard deviation, \\(\\sigma\\). 3.3.2 Normal distribution The normal distribution (sometimes referred to as the Gaussian distribution) is a common probability distribution and many continuous random variables can be described by the normal distribution or be approximated by the normal distribution. The normal probability density function \\[f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi} \\sigma} e^{-\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^2}\\] describes the distribution of a normal random variable, \\(X\\), with expected value \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\), \\(e\\) and \\(\\pi\\) are two common mathematical constants, \\(e \\approx 2.71828\\) and \\(\\pi \\approx 3.14159\\). In short we write \\(X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma)\\). The bell-shaped normal distributions is symmetric around \\(\\mu\\) and \\(f(x) \\rightarrow 0\\) as \\(x \\rightarrow \\infty\\) and as \\(x \\rightarrow -\\infty\\). As \\(f(x)\\) is well defined, values for the cumulative distribution function \\(F(x) = \\int_{- \\infty}^x f(x) dx\\) can be computed. If \\(X\\) is normally distributed with expected value \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) we write: \\[X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma)\\] Using transformation rules we can define \\[Z = \\frac{X-\\mu}{\\sigma}, \\, Z \\sim N(0,1)\\] Values for the cumulative standard normal distribution, \\(F(z)\\), are tabulated and easy to compute in R using the function pnorm. Figure 3.6: The shaded area under hte curve is the tabulated value \\(P(Z \\leq z) = F(z)\\). Table 3.1: Normal distribution. The table gives \\(F(z) = P(Z \\leq z)\\) for \\(Z \\in N(0,1)\\). 0 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 0.07 0.08 0.09 0.0 0.5000 0.5040 0.5080 0.5120 0.5160 0.5199 0.5239 0.5279 0.5319 0.5359 0.1 0.5398 0.5438 0.5478 0.5517 0.5557 0.5596 0.5636 0.5675 0.5714 0.5753 0.2 0.5793 0.5832 0.5871 0.5910 0.5948 0.5987 0.6026 0.6064 0.6103 0.6141 0.3 0.6179 0.6217 0.6255 0.6293 0.6331 0.6368 0.6406 0.6443 0.6480 0.6517 0.4 0.6554 0.6591 0.6628 0.6664 0.6700 0.6736 0.6772 0.6808 0.6844 0.6879 0.5 0.6915 0.6950 0.6985 0.7019 0.7054 0.7088 0.7123 0.7157 0.7190 0.7224 0.6 0.7257 0.7291 0.7324 0.7357 0.7389 0.7422 0.7454 0.7486 0.7517 0.7549 0.7 0.7580 0.7611 0.7642 0.7673 0.7704 0.7734 0.7764 0.7794 0.7823 0.7852 0.8 0.7881 0.7910 0.7939 0.7967 0.7995 0.8023 0.8051 0.8078 0.8106 0.8133 0.9 0.8159 0.8186 0.8212 0.8238 0.8264 0.8289 0.8315 0.8340 0.8365 0.8389 1.0 0.8413 0.8438 0.8461 0.8485 0.8508 0.8531 0.8554 0.8577 0.8599 0.8621 1.1 0.8643 0.8665 0.8686 0.8708 0.8729 0.8749 0.8770 0.8790 0.8810 0.8830 1.2 0.8849 0.8869 0.8888 0.8907 0.8925 0.8944 0.8962 0.8980 0.8997 0.9015 1.3 0.9032 0.9049 0.9066 0.9082 0.9099 0.9115 0.9131 0.9147 0.9162 0.9177 1.4 0.9192 0.9207 0.9222 0.9236 0.9251 0.9265 0.9279 0.9292 0.9306 0.9319 1.5 0.9332 0.9345 0.9357 0.9370 0.9382 0.9394 0.9406 0.9418 0.9429 0.9441 1.6 0.9452 0.9463 0.9474 0.9484 0.9495 0.9505 0.9515 0.9525 0.9535 0.9545 1.7 0.9554 0.9564 0.9573 0.9582 0.9591 0.9599 0.9608 0.9616 0.9625 0.9633 1.8 0.9641 0.9649 0.9656 0.9664 0.9671 0.9678 0.9686 0.9693 0.9699 0.9706 1.9 0.9713 0.9719 0.9726 0.9732 0.9738 0.9744 0.9750 0.9756 0.9761 0.9767 2.0 0.9772 0.9778 0.9783 0.9788 0.9793 0.9798 0.9803 0.9808 0.9812 0.9817 2.1 0.9821 0.9826 0.9830 0.9834 0.9838 0.9842 0.9846 0.9850 0.9854 0.9857 2.2 0.9861 0.9864 0.9868 0.9871 0.9875 0.9878 0.9881 0.9884 0.9887 0.9890 2.3 0.9893 0.9896 0.9898 0.9901 0.9904 0.9906 0.9909 0.9911 0.9913 0.9916 2.4 0.9918 0.9920 0.9922 0.9925 0.9927 0.9929 0.9931 0.9932 0.9934 0.9936 2.5 0.9938 0.9940 0.9941 0.9943 0.9945 0.9946 0.9948 0.9949 0.9951 0.9952 2.6 0.9953 0.9955 0.9956 0.9957 0.9959 0.9960 0.9961 0.9962 0.9963 0.9964 2.7 0.9965 0.9966 0.9967 0.9968 0.9969 0.9970 0.9971 0.9972 0.9973 0.9974 2.8 0.9974 0.9975 0.9976 0.9977 0.9977 0.9978 0.9979 0.9979 0.9980 0.9981 2.9 0.9981 0.9982 0.9982 0.9983 0.9984 0.9984 0.9985 0.9985 0.9986 0.9986 3.0 0.9987 0.9987 0.9987 0.9988 0.9988 0.9989 0.9989 0.9989 0.9990 0.9990 3.1 0.9990 0.9991 0.9991 0.9991 0.9992 0.9992 0.9992 0.9992 0.9993 0.9993 3.2 0.9993 0.9993 0.9994 0.9994 0.9994 0.9994 0.9994 0.9995 0.9995 0.9995 3.3 0.9995 0.9995 0.9995 0.9996 0.9996 0.9996 0.9996 0.9996 0.9996 0.9997 3.4 0.9997 0.9997 0.9997 0.9997 0.9997 0.9997 0.9997 0.9997 0.9997 0.9998 Some value of particular interest: \\[F(1.64) = 0.95\\\\ F(1.96) = 0.975\\] As the normal distribution is symmetric F(-z) = 1 - F(z) \\[F(-1.64) = 0.05\\\\ F(-1.96) = 0.025\\] \\[P(-1.96 &lt; Z &lt; 1.96) = 0.95\\] 3.3.2.1 Sum of two normal random variables If \\(X \\sim N(\\mu_1, \\sigma_1)\\) and \\(Y \\sim N(\\mu_2, \\sigma_2)\\) are two independent normal random variables, then their sum is also a random variable: \\[X + Y \\sim N(\\mu_1 + \\mu_2, \\sqrt{\\sigma_1^2 + \\sigma_2^2})\\] and \\[X - Y \\sim N(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2, \\sqrt{\\sigma_1^2 + \\sigma_2^2})\\] This can be extended to the case with \\(n\\) independent and identically distributed random varibles \\(X_i\\) (\\(i=1 \\dots n\\)). If all \\(X_i\\) are normally distributed with mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\), \\(X_i \\in N(\\mu, \\sigma)\\), then the sum of all \\(n\\) random variables will also be normally distributed with mean \\(n\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sqrt{n} \\sigma\\). 3.3.3 Central limit theorem Theorem 3.1 The sum of \\(n\\) independent and equally distributed random variables is normally distributed, if \\(n\\) is large enough. As a result of central limit theorem, the distribution of fractions or mean values of a sample follow the normal distribution, at least if the sample is large enough (a rule of thumb is that the sample size \\(n&gt;30\\)). Example 3.4 Mean BMI In a population of 252 men we can study the distribution of BMI. ##Population mean (mu &lt;- mean(fat$BMI)) ## [1] 25 ##Population variance (sigma2 &lt;- var(fat$BMI)/nrow(fat)*(nrow(fat)-1)) ## [1] 13 ##Population standard variance (sigma &lt;- sqrt(sigma2)) ## [1] 3.6 Randomly sample 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 men and compute the mean value, \\(m\\). Repeat many times to get the distribution of mean values. Note, mean is just the sum divided by the number of samples \\(n\\). 3.3.4 \\(\\chi^2\\)-distribution The random variable \\(Y = \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2\\) is \\(\\chi^2\\) distributed with \\(n-1\\) degrees of freedom, if \\(X_i\\) are independent identically distributed random variables \\(X_i \\in N(0,1)\\). In short \\(Y \\in \\chi^2(n-1)\\). Figure 3.7: The \\(\\chi^2\\)-distribution. 3.3.5 F-distribution The ratio of two \\(\\chi^2\\)-distributed variables divided by their degrees of freedom is F-distributed Figure 3.8: The F-distribution Example 3.5 The ratio of two sample variances is F-distributed 3.3.6 t-distribution The ratio of a normally distributed variable and a \\(\\chi^2\\)-distributed variable is t-distributed. Figure 3.9: The t-distribution. Example 3.6 t-distribution The ratio between sample mean and sample variance is t-distributed. 3.3.7 Distributions in R Probability density functions for the normal, t, \\(\\chi^2\\) and F distributions can in R can be computed using functions dnorm, dt, dchisq, and df, respectively. Cumulative distribution functions can be computed using pnorm, pt, pchisq and pf. Also, functions for computing an \\(x\\) such that \\(P(X&lt;x) = q\\), where \\(q\\) is a probability of interest are available using qnorm, qt, qchisq and qf.

What is the probability of a random man being anemic? b) When randomly selecting 10 men from the population, what is the probability that none of them are anemic? Exercise 3.16 A rare disease affects 3 in 100000 in a large population. If 10000 people are randomly selected from the population, what is the probability that no one in the sample is affected? that at least two in the sample are affected? Exercise 3.17 A drug company is producing a pill, with on average 12 mg of active substance. The amount of active substance is normally distributed with mean 12 mg and standard deviation 0.5 mg, if the production is without problems. Sometimes there is a problem with the production and the amount of active substance will be too high or too low, in which case the pill has to be discarded.

Instead we study a random sample. A random sample is a random subset of individuals from a population. A simple random sample is a random subset of individuals from a population, where every individual has the same probability of being choosen. 3.4.1 The urn model to perform simple random sampling Let every individual in the population be represented by a ball. The value on each ball is the measurement we are interested in, for example height, shoe size, hair color, healthy/sick, type of cancer/no cancer, blood glucose value, etc. Draw \\(n\\) balls from the urn, without replacement, to get a random sample of size \\(n\\). 3.4.2 Sample properties Summary statistics can be computed for a sample, such as the sum, proportion, mean and variance. Notation: A random sample \\(x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n\\) from a distribution, \\(D\\), consists of \\(n\\) observations of the independent random variables \\(X_1, X_2,\\dots,X_n\\) all with the distribution \\(D\\). 3.4.2.1 Sample proportion The proportion of a population with a particular property is \\(\\pi\\). The number of individuals with the property in a simple random sample of size \\(n\\) is a random variable \\(X\\). The proportion of individuals in a sample with the property is also a random variable; \\[P = \\frac{X}{n}\\] with expected value \\[E[P] = \\frac{E[X]}{n} = \\frac{n\\pi}{n} = \\pi\\] 3.4.3 Sample mean and standard deviation For a particular sample of size \\(n\\); \\(x_1, \\dots, x_n\\), the sample mean is denoted \\(m = \\bar x\\). The sample mean is calculated as; \\[m = \\bar x = \\frac{1}{n}\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\\] and the sample variance as; \\[s^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-m)^2\\] Note that the mean of \\(n\\) independent identically distributed random variables, \\(X_i\\) is itself a random variable; \\[\\bar X = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i,\\] If \\(X_i \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma)\\) then \\(\\bar X \\sim N\\left(\\mu, \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right)\\). When we only have a sample of size \\(n\\), the sample mean \\(m\\) is our best estimate of the population mean. It is possible to show that the sample mean is an unbiased estimate of the population mean, i.e. the average (over many size \\(n\\) samples) of the sample mean is \\(\\mu\\). \\[E[\\bar X] = \\frac{1}{n} n E[X] = E[X] = \\mu\\] Similarly, the sample variance is an unbiased estimate of the population variance. 3.4.4 Standard error Eventhough the sample can be used to calculate unbiased estimates of the population value, the sample estimate will not be perfect. The standard deviation of the sampling distribution (the distribution of sample estimates) is called the standard error. For the sample mean, \\(\\bar X\\), the variance is \\[E[(\\bar X - \\mu)] = var(\\bar X) = var(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_i X_i) = \\frac{1}{n^2} \\sum_i var(X_i) = \\frac{1}{n^2} n var(X) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}\\] The standard error of the mean is thus; \\[SEM = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\] Replacing \\(\\sigma\\) with the sample standard deviation, \\(s\\), we get an estimate of the standard deviation of the mean; \\[SEM \\approx \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\\] An alternative definition of standard error of the mean is actually \\[SEM = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\\] "],["session-inference.html", "Chapter 4 Statistical Inference 4.1 Hypothesis test Exercises: Hypothesis tests, resampling 4.2 Parametric tests Exercises: Hypothesis tests, parametric 4.3 Point and interval estimates Exercises: Interval estimates 4.4 Multiple testing", " Chapter 4 Statistical Inference Learning outcomes: to define null and alternative hypothesis to perform a hypothesis test using resampling to perform a t-test to understand and define sampling distribution and standard error to compute standard error of mean and proportions to compute confidence interval of mean and proportions using the normal approximation to compute confidence interval of mean using the t-distribution Statistical inference is to draw conclusions regarding properties of a population based on observations of a random sample from the population. 4.1 Hypothesis test To perform a hypothesis test is to evaluate a hypothesis based on a random sample. Typicaly, the hypotheses that are tested are assumptions about properties of the population, such as proportion, mean, mean difference, variance etc. 4.1.1 The null and alternative hypothesis There are two hypotheses involved in a hypothesis test, the null hypothesis, \\(H_0\\), and the alternative hypothesis, \\(H_1\\). The null hypothesis is in general neutral, “no change”, “no difference between groups”, “no association”. In general we want to show that \\(H_0\\) is false. The alternative hypothesis expresses what the researcher is interested in “the treatment has an effect”, “there is a difference between groups”, “there is an association”. The alternative hypothesis can also be directional “the treatment has a positive effect”. 4.1.2 To perform a hypothesis test Define \\(H_0\\) and \\(H_1\\) Select appropriate test statistic, \\(T\\), and compute the observed value, \\(t_{obs}\\) Assume that the \\(H_0\\) is true and compute the sampling distribution of \\(T\\). Select an appropriate significance level, \\(\\alpha\\) Compare the observed value, \\(t_{obs}\\), with the computed sampling distribution under \\(H_0\\) and compute a p-value. The p-value is the probability of observing a value at least as extreme as the observed value, if \\(H_0\\) is true. Based on the p-value either accept or reject \\(H_0\\). Definition 4.1 Sampling distribution A sampling distribution is the distribution of a sample statistic. The samplling distribution can be obtained by drawing a large number of samples from a specific population. Definition 4.2 Null distribution The null distribution is a sampling distribution when the null hypothesis is true. Figure 4.1: A null distribution Definition 4.3 p-value The p-value is the probability of the observed value, or something more extreme, if the null hypothesis is true. Figure 4.2: The p-value is the probability to observe \\(x_{obs}\\) or something more extreme, if the null hypothesis is true. 4.1.3 Significance level and error types H0 is true H0 is false Accept H0 Type II error, miss Reject H0 Type I error, false alarm The significance level, \\(\\alpha\\) = P(false alarm) = P(Reject \\(H_0\\)|\\(H_0\\) is true). The significance level is the risk to of false alarm, i.e. to say “I have a hit”, “I found a difference”, when the the null hypothesis (“there is no difference”) is true. The risk of false alarm is control by setting the significance level to a disired value. We do want to keep the risk of false alarm (type I error) low, but at the same time we don’t want to many missed hits (type II error). The significance level should be set before the hypothesis test is performed. Common values to use are 0.05 or 0.01. If the p-value is above the significance level, \\(H_0\\) is accepted. If the p-value is below the significance level, \\(H_0\\) is rejected. 4.1.4 Hypothesis test, simulation examples In these examples the significance level is set to 0.05. Example 4.1 Pollen allergy Let’s assume we know that the proportion of pollen allergy in Sweden is \\(0.3\\). We suspect that the number of pollen allergic has increased in Uppsala in the last couple of years and want to investigate this. Observe 100 people from Uppsala, 42 of these were allergic to pollen. Is there a reason to believe that the proportion of pollen allergic in Uppsala \\(\\pi &gt; 0.3\\)? Null and alternative hypotheses \\(H_0:\\) The proportion of pollen allergy in Uppsala is the same as in Sweden as a whole. \\(H_1:\\) The proportion of pollen allergy in Uppsala is not the same as in Sweden as a whole. or expressed differently; \\[H_0:\\, \\pi=\\pi_0\\] \\[H_1:\\, \\pi&gt;\\pi_0\\] where \\(\\pi\\) is the unknown proportion of pollen allergy in the Uppsala population that. \\(\\pi_0 = 0.3\\) is the proportion of pollen allergy in Sweden. Test statistic Here we are interested in the proportion of pollen allergic in Uppsala. An appropriate test statistic could be the number of pollen allergic in a sample of size \\(n=100\\), \\(X\\). As an alternative we can use the proportion of pollen allergic in a sample of size \\(n\\), \\[P = \\frac{X}{n}\\] Let’s use \\(P\\) as our test statistic and compute the observed value, \\(p_{obs}\\). In our sample of 100 people from Uppsala the proportion allergic to pollen is \\(p=42/100=0.42\\). Null distribution The sampling distribution of \\(P\\) under \\(H_0\\) (i.e. when the null hypothesis is true) is what we call the null distribution. \\(H_0\\) state that \\(\\pi=0.3\\). We can model this using an urn model as follows; Figure 4.3: An urn model of the null hypothesis \\(\\pi=0.3\\). The black balls represent allergic and the white balls non-allergic. Using this model, we can simulate taking a sample of size 100 many times. ## Urn rep(c(0, 1), c(7, 3)) ## [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 ## Sample 100 times with replacement sample(rep(c(0, 1), c(7, 3)), 100, replace=TRUE) ## [1] 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 ## [38] 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 ## [75] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 ## Compute proportion of samples that are allergic (1) sum(sample(rep(c(0, 1), c(7, 3)), 100, replace=TRUE))/100 ## [1] 0.3 ## Draw samples of size 100 and compute proporion allergic 100000 times p &lt;- replicate(100000, mean(sample(rep(c(0, 1), c(7, 3)), 100, replace=TRUE))) Finally plot the distribution Figure 4.4: The sampling distribution.

Example 4.2 Permutation test: Do high fat diet lead to increased body weight? Study setup: Order 24 female mice from a lab. Randomly assign 12 of the 24 mice to receive high-fat diet, the remaining 12 are controls (ordinary diet). Measure body weight after one week. The observed values, mouse weights in grams, are summarized below; high-fat 25 30 23 18 31 24 39 26 36 29 23 32 ordinary 27 25 22 23 25 37 24 26 21 26 30 24 Null and alternative hypotheses \\[ \\begin{aligned} H_0: \\mu_2 = \\mu_1 \\iff \\mu_2 - \\mu_1 = 0\\\\ H_1: \\mu_2&gt;\\mu_1 \\iff \\mu_2-\\mu_1 &gt; 0 \\end{aligned} \\] where \\(\\mu_2\\) is the (unknown) mean body weight of the high-fat mouse population and \\(\\mu_1\\) is the mean body-weight of the control mouse population. Studied population: Female mice that can be ordered from a lab. Test statistic Here we are interested in the mean difference between high-fat and control mice. Mean weight of 12 (randomly selected) mice on ordinary diet, \\(\\bar X_1\\). \\(E[\\bar X_1] = E[X_1] = \\mu_1\\) Mean weight of 12 (randomly selected) mice on high-fat diet, \\(\\bar X_2\\). \\(E[\\bar X_2] = E[X_2] = \\mu_2\\) The mean difference is also a random variable: \\(D = \\bar X_2 - \\bar X_1\\) Observed values; ## 12 HF mice xHF &lt;- c(25, 30, 23, 18, 31, 24, 39, 26, 36, 29, 23, 32) ## 12 control mice xN &lt;- c(27, 25, 22, 23, 25, 37, 24, 26, 21, 26, 30, 24) ##Compute mean body weights of the two samples mHF &lt;- mean(xHF) mN &lt;- mean(xN) ## Compute mean difference dobs &lt;- mHF - mN Mean weight of control mice (ordinary diet): \\(\\bar x_1 = 25.83\\) Mean weight of mice on high-fat diet: \\(\\bar x_2 = 28.00\\) Difference in mean weights: \\(d_{obs} = \\bar x_2 - \\bar x_1 = 2.1667\\) Null distribution If high-fat diet has no effect, i.e. if \\(H_0\\) was true, the result would be as if all mice were given the same diet. What can we expect if all mice are fed with the same type of food? This can be accomplished using permutation The 24 mice were initially from the same population, depending on how the mice are randomly assigned to high-fat and normal group, the mean weights would differ, even if the two groups were treated the same. Assume \\(H_0\\) is true, i.e. assume all mice are equivalent and Randomly reassign 12 of the 24 mice to ‘high-fat’ and the remaining 12 to ‘control’. Compute difference in mean weights If we repeat 1-2 many times we get the sampling distribution when \\(H_0\\) is true, the so called null distribution, of difference in mean weights. ## All 24 body weights in a vector x &lt;- c(xHF, xN) ## Mean difference (dobs &lt;- mean(x[1:12]) - mean(x[13:24])) ## [1] 2.167 ## Permute once (y &lt;- sample(x)) ## [1] 29 36 39 31 26 24 25 23 25 27 32 37 30 23 30 18 24 23 24 26 22 26 21 25 ##Compute mean difference mean(y[1:12]) - mean(y[13:24]) ## [1] 5.167 dnull.perm &lt;- replicate(n = 100000, { y &lt;- sample(x) ##Mean difference mean(y[1:12]) - mean(y[13:24]) }) ggplot(data.frame(d=dnull.perm), aes(x=d)) + geom_histogram(bins=25, color=&quot;white&quot;) + theme_bw() + geom_vline(xintercept=dobs, color=&quot;red&quot;) ##Alternatively plot using hist ## hist(dnull.perm) Compute p-value What is the probability to get an at least as extreme mean difference as our observed value, \\(d_{obs}\\), if \\(H_0\\) was true? ## Compute the p-value sum(dnull.perm&gt;dobs)/length(dnull.perm) ## [1] 0.1492 mean(dnull.perm&gt;dobs) ## [1] 0.1492 $P(X_2 - X_1 d_{obs} | H_0) = $ 0.168 Conclusion? Exercises: Hypothesis tests, resampling Exercise 4.1 You believe that the proportion of Swedish students allergic to pollen is greater than 0.3 (the proportion allergic to pollen in Sweden). To test this you observe 20 people in a student group at BMC in Uppsala, 9 or them are allergic to pollen. Is this reason to believe that the proportion of Swedish students allergic to pollen i greater than 0.3? Can you identify any problems with this study setup? Exercise 4.2 A diet study aims to study how the hemoglobin (Hb) levels in blood are affected by an iron-rich diet consisting of tofu, soybeans, broccoli, lentils and peas. To perform the study the dietician has recruited 40 male participants, who are randomly assigned to the iron-rich diet or control group (no change in participants diet), 20 participant in each group. The observed Hb levels (in g/L); ctrl &lt;- c(197, 186, 157, 170, 193, 188, 175, 186, 177, 191, 168, 193, 191, 189, 188, 192, 179, 186, 197, 203) iron &lt;- c(187, 218, 196, 210, 206, 178, 181, 193, 172, 202, 169, 221, 183, 222, 185, 174, 192, 192, 162, 211) Perform a hypothesis test to investigate if the Hb level is affected (increased or decreased) by the iron-rich diet. 4.2 Parametric tests In previous chapters we have computed the sampling distribution using resampling techniques to be able to perform hypothesis tests or compute interval estimates. If the null distribution was already known (or could be computed based on a few assumptions) resampling would not be necessary. We can follow the same steps as before to perform a hypothesis test: Define \\(H_0\\) and \\(H_1\\) Select appropriate test statistic, \\(T\\), and compute the observed value, \\(t_{obs}\\) Assume that the \\(H_0\\) and derive the null distribution of the test statistic based on appropriate assumptions. Select an appropriate significance level, \\(\\alpha\\) Compare the observed value, \\(t_{obs}\\), with the null distribution and compute a p-value. The p-value is the probability of observing a value at least as extreme as the observed value, if \\(H_0\\) is true. Based on the p-value either accept or reject \\(H_0\\). 4.2.1 One sample, proportions Example 4.3 Let’s get back to the pollen example! Assume that the proportion of pollen allergy in Sweden is known to be \\(0.3\\). Observe 100 people from Uppsala, 42 of these were allergic to pollen. Is there a reason to believe that the proportion of pollen allergic in Uppsala \\(\\pi &gt; 0.3\\)? The number of allergic individuals in a sample of size \\(n\\) is \\(X\\) and the proportion of allergic persons is \\(P = X/n\\). \\(X\\) is binomially distributed, but here we can use the Central limit theorem, see 3.1. Theorem 4.1 The sum of \\(n\\) independent and equally distributed random variables is normally distributed, if \\(n\\) is large enough. As a result of the central limit theorem, the distribution of number or proportion of allergic individuals in a sample of size \\(n\\) is approximately normal. At least if the sample is large enough. A rule of thumb is that the sample size should be \\(n&gt;30\\). Here, the sample size is 100! The normal distribution has two parameters, mean and standard deviation. From the binomial distribution we know that \\(E[X] = \\pi\\) and \\(var(X) = n\\pi(1-\\pi)\\). Hence \\(E[P] = \\pi\\) and \\(var(P) = \\frac{\\pi(1-\\pi)}{n}\\). The standard error is thus \\[SE=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi(1-\\pi)}{n}}\\] When the null hypothesis is true \\(\\pi\\) is known and \\(\\pi=0.3\\). Actually these calculations are true in general when a proportion in one sample is compared to a known value. \\[H_0: \\pi=\\pi_0 \\\\ H_1: \\pi&gt;\\pi_0 \\] Ather potential alternative hypothesis are \\(H_1: \\pi&lt;\\pi_0\\) or \\(H_1:\\pi \\neq \\pi_0\\), but in this particular example we are only interested in the alternative that \\(\\pi &gt; \\pi_0\\). If \\(H_0\\) is true \\(\\pi=\\pi_0\\) and \\[P \\sim N\\left(\\pi_0, \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi_0(1-\\pi_0)}{n}}\\right)\\] An appropriate test statistic is \\[Z = \\frac{P-\\pi_0}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi_0(1-\\pi_0)}{n}}}\\] \\(Z \\in N(0,1)\\) which makes probabilities easy to compute. Back to our example, replace \\(P\\) with our observed value \\(p=0.42\\) and \\(\\pi_0=0.3\\) and compute our observed \\[Z_{obs} = \\frac{0.42-0.3}{\\sqrt{\\frac{0.3(1-0.3)}{100}}} = 2.62\\] The p-value is the probability of the observed value, or something more extreme, if the null hypothesis is true. If the computed probability is below \\(\\alpha=0.05\\) our significance threshold, \\(H_0\\) will be rejected. \\[p = P(P \\geq \\pi_0) = P(Z \\geq Z_{obs}) = P(Z \\geq 2.62) = 1 - P(Z \\leq 2.62) = [table] = 1 - 0.996 = 0.0044\\] As 0.0044&lt;0.05 we reject \\(H_0\\) and conclude that there is reason to believe that the proportion of allergic in Uppsala is greater than 0.3. 4.2.2 One sample, mean A one sample test of means compares the mean of a sample to a prespecified value. For example, we might know that the weight of a mouse on normal diet is normally distributed with mean 24.0 g and standard deviation 3 g and want to compare the weight of a sample of 10 mice on high-fat diet to the known mean value for mice on normal diet. The hypotheses: \\[H_0: \\mu = \\mu_0 \\\\ H_1: \\mu \\neq \\mu_0\\] The alternative hypothesis, \\(H_1,\\) above is for the two sided hypothesis test. Other options are the one sided \\(H_1\\); \\(H_1: \\mu &gt; \\mu_0\\) or \\(H_1: \\mu &lt; \\mu_0\\). If \\[X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma)\\] (this could for example be the weight of a mouse on high-fat diet) then the sample mean \\[\\bar X \\sim N\\left(\\mu, \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right).\\] If \\(\\sigma\\) is known the test statistic \\[Z = \\frac{\\bar X - \\mu}{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}}\\] is normally distributed, \\(\\sim N(0,1)\\). For small \\(n\\) and unknown \\(\\sigma\\), the test statistic \\[t = \\frac{\\bar X - \\mu}{\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}}\\] is t-distributed with \\(df=n-1\\) degrees of freedom. 4.2.3 Two samples, proportions \\[H_0: \\pi_1 - \\pi_2 = 0\\\\ H_1: \\pi_1 - \\pi_2 \\neq 0\\] Alternatively, a one sided alternative hypothesis can be used; \\(H_1: \\pi_1 - \\pi_2 &gt;0\\) or \\(H_1: \\pi_1 - \\pi_2 &lt; 0\\). Test statistic \\[Z = \\frac{P_1 - P_2}{\\sqrt{P(1-P)\\left (\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2}\\right)}}\\] where \\(P\\) is the proportion in the merged sample of size \\(n_1 + n_2\\). \\(Z \\in N(0,1)\\) and p-value can be computed using the standard normal distribution. 4.2.4 Two samples, mean A two sample test of means is used to determine if two population means are equal. Two independent samples are collected (one from each population) and the means are compared. Can for example be used to determine if a treatment group is different compared to a control group, in terms of the mean of a property of interest. The null hypothesis; \\[H_0: \\mu_2 = \\mu_1\\] The alternative hypothesis can either be two sided \\[H_1: \\mu_2 \\neq \\mu_1\\] or one sided \\[H_1: \\mu_2 &gt; \\mu_1\\] or \\[H_1: \\mu_2 &lt; \\mu_1\\] Assume that observations from both populations are normally distributed; \\[ \\begin{aligned} X_1 \\sim N(\\mu_1, \\sigma_1) \\\\ X_2 \\sim N(\\mu_2, \\sigma_2) \\end{aligned} \\] Then it follows that the sample means will also be normally distributed; \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\bar X_1 \\sim N(\\mu_1, \\sigma_1/\\sqrt{n_1}) \\\\ \\bar X_2 \\sim N(\\mu_2, \\sigma_2/\\sqrt{n_2}) \\end{aligned} \\] The mean difference \\(D = \\bar X_2 - \\bar X_1\\) is thus also normally distributed: \\[D = \\bar X_2 - \\bar X_1 = N\\left(\\mu_2-\\mu_1, \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{n_2} + \\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1}}\\right)\\] If \\(H_0\\) is true: \\[D = \\bar X_2 - \\bar X_1 = N\\left(0, \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{n_2} + \\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1}}\\right)\\] The test statistic: \\[Z = \\frac{\\bar X_2 - \\bar X_1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{n_2} + \\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1}}}\\] is standard normal, i.e. \\(Z \\sim N(0,1)\\). However, note that the test statistic require the standard deviations \\(\\sigma_1\\) and \\(\\sigma_2\\) to be known. What if the population standard deviations are not known? If the sample sizes are large, we can replace the known standard deviations with our sample standard deviations and according to the central limit theorem assume that \\[Z = \\frac{\\bar X_2 - \\bar X_1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{s_2^2}{n_2} + \\frac{s_1^2}{n_1}}} \\sim N(0,1)\\] and proceed as before. For small sample sizes the test statistic will be t-distributed. \\[t = \\frac{\\bar X_2 - \\bar X_1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{s_2^2}{n_2} + \\frac{s_1^2}{n_1}}}\\] For small sample sizes we can use Student’s t-test, which requires us to assume that \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) both are normally distributed and have equal variances. With these assumptions we can compute the pooled variance \\[ s_p^2 = \\frac{(n_1-1)s_1^2 + (n_2-1)s_2^2}{n_1+n_2-2} \\] and the test statistic \\[t = \\frac{\\bar X_1 - \\bar X_2}{\\sqrt{s_p^2(\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2})}}\\] \\(t\\) is t-distributed with \\(n_1+n_2-2\\) degrees of freedom. The t-test is implemented in R, e.g. in the function t.test in the R-package stats, both Student’s t-test with equal variances and Welch’s t-test with unequal variances. 4.2.5 Variance The test of equal variance in two groups is based on the null hypothesis \\[H_0: \\sigma_1^2 = \\sigma_2^2\\] If the two samples both come from two populations with normal distributions, the sample variances \\[S_1^2 = \\frac{1}{n_1-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n_1} (X_{1i}-\\bar X_1)^2\\\\ S_2^2 = \\frac{1}{n_2-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n_2} (X_{2i}-\\bar X_2)^2\\] It can be shown that \\(\\frac{(n_1-1)S_1^2}{\\sigma_1^2} \\sim \\chi^2(n_1-1)\\) and \\(\\frac{(n_2-1)S_2^2}{\\sigma_2^2} \\sim \\chi^2(n_2-1)\\). Hence, the test statistic for comparing the variances of two groups \\[F = \\frac{S_1^2}{S_2^2}\\] is \\(F\\)-distributed with \\(n_1-1\\) and \\(n_2-1\\) degrees of freedom. In R a test of equal variances can be performed using the function var.test. Exercises: Hypothesis tests, parametric Exercise 4.3 The hemoglobin value (Hb) in women is on average 140 g/L. You observe the following Hb values in a set of five male blood donors: 154, 140, 147, 162, 172. Assume that Hb is normally distributed. Is there a reason to believe that the mean Hb value in men differ from that in women? Exercise 4.4 The hemoglobin value (Hb) in men is on average 188 g/L. The Hb values in 4.4 were actually measured after the men had donated blood. Is there a reason to believe that the mean Hb level after blood donation is less than 188 g/L? Exercise 4.5 By observing the Hb values in 5 male blood donors; 154, 140, 147, 162, 172 g/L, and 5 female blood donors: 123, 140, 137, 132, 127 g/L, is there a reason to believe that the Hb level is higher in men than in women?

When we only have a sample, the sample estimate will be our best guess of the population value, but it will not be without error. If we are interested in how large proportion of the Uppsala population is allergic to pollen, we can investigate this by studying a random sample. Randomly select 100 persons in Uppsala. It is important to actually sample randomly, ideally every individual should have the same probability of being sampled. In our sample, we observe that 42 of the 100 has a pollen allergy. Hence, the observed sample proportion is \\(p=0.42\\). Based on this observation our point estimate of the Uppsla popultation proportion \\(\\pi\\) is \\(\\pi \\approx p = 0.42\\). We know that there is a certain uncertainty in this measurement, if the experiment is repeated we would select 100 other persons and our point estimate would be slightly different. 4.3.1 Bootstrap interval Using bootstrap we can sample with replacement from our sample to estimate the uncertainty. Bootstrap is to use the data we have (our sample) and sample repeatedly with replacement from this data. Put the entire sample in an urn! Figure 4.6: An urn model with 42 allergy (black) and 58 non-allergy (white). The black balls represent allergic and the white balls non-allergic. Sample from the urn with replacement to compute the bootstrap distribution. Using the bootstrap distribution the uncertainty of our estimate of \\(\\pi\\) can be estimated. The 95% bootstrap interval is [0.32, 0.52]. The bootstrap is very useful if you do not know the distribution of our sampled propery. But in our example we actually do. 4.3.2 Confidence interval A confidence interval is a type of interval estimate associated with a confidence level. 4.3.2.1 Confidence interval of proportions Remember that we can use the central limit theorem to show that \\[P \\sim N\\left(\\pi, SE\\right) \\iff P \\sim \\left(\\pi, \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi(1-\\pi)}{n}}\\right)\\] It follows that \\[Z = \\frac{P - \\pi}{SE} \\sim N(0,1)\\] Based on what we know of the standard normal distribution, we can compute an interval around the population property \\(\\pi\\) such that the probability that a sample property \\(p\\) fall within this interval is \\(1-\\alpha\\). \\[P(-z &lt; \\frac{P - \\pi}{SE} &lt; z) = 1 - \\alpha\\] For a 95% confidence interval z=1.96 (from a table of the standard normal distribution). Other confidence levels of interest include 90% (z=1.64) and 99% (z=2.58). \\[P\\left(-z &lt; \\frac{P-\\pi}{SE}&lt;z\\right) = \\left(-z &lt; Z &lt;z\\right) = 1-\\alpha\\] We can rewrite this to \\[P\\left(\\pi-z SE &lt; P &lt; \\pi + z SE\\right) = 1-\\alpha\\] in other words sample fraction \\(p\\) will fall between \\(\\pi \\pm 1.96 SE\\) with 95% probability. The equation can also be rewritten to \\[P\\left(P-z SE &lt; \\pi &lt; P + z SE\\right) = 1 - \\alpha\\] The observed confidence interval is what we get when we replace the random variable \\(P\\) with our observed fraction, \\[p-z SE &lt; \\pi &lt; p + z SE\\] \\[\\pi = p \\pm z SE = p \\pm z \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\\] The 95% confidence interval \\[\\pi = p \\pm 1.96 \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\\] A 95% confidence interval will have 95% chance to cover the true value. Back to our example of proportion pollen allergic in Uppsala. \\(p=0.42\\) and \\(SE=\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} = 0.0494\\). Hence, the 95% confidence interval is \\[\\pi = 0.42 \\pm 1.96 * 0.05 = 0.42 \\pm 0.092\\] or \\[(0.42-0.092, 0.42+0.092) = (0.32, 0.52)\\] 4.3.2.1.1 Confidence interval of mean The confidence interval of mean can be derived similarly. The mean of a sample of \\(n\\) independent and identically normal distributed observations \\(X_i\\) is normally distributed; \\[\\bar X \\sim N(\\mu, \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}})\\] If \\(\\sigma\\) is unknown the statistic \\[\\frac{\\bar X - \\mu}{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}} \\sim t(n-1)\\] is t-distributed with \\(n-1\\) degrees of freedom. It follows that \\[ \\begin{aligned} P\\left(-t &lt; \\frac{\\bar X - \\mu}{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}} &lt; t\\right) = 1 - \\alpha \\iff \\\\ P\\left(\\bar X - t \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} &lt; \\mu &lt; \\bar X + t \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right) = 1 - \\alpha \\end{aligned} \\] The confidence interval with confidence level \\(1-\\alpha\\) is thus; \\[\\mu = \\bar x \\pm t \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\\] For a 95% confidence interval and \\(n=5\\) \\(t\\) is 2.7764. The \\(t\\) values for different values of \\(\\alpha\\) and degrees of freedom are tabulated and can be computed in R using the function qt. n=5 alpha = 0.05 ## t value qt(1-alpha/2, df=n-1) ## [1] 2.776 Exercises: Interval estimates Exercise 4.7 You measure the Hb value in 10 50-year old men and get the following observations; 145, 165, 134, 167, 158, 176, 156, 189, 143, 123 g/L.

Compute the sample mean Hb value Compute the sample variance Compute the sample standard deviation Assume that Hb is normally distributed and compute a 95% confidence interval for the mean Hb value.

We computed a 95% interval, what if we want a 90% confidence interval? or a 99% confidence interval? Exercise 4.9 A scale has a normally distributed error with mean 0 and standard deviation 2.3 g.

Objections: too conservative 4.4.3 Benjamini-Hochbergs FDR H0 is true H0 is false Accept H0 TN FN Reject H0 FP TP The false discovery rate is the proportion of false positives among ‘hits’, i.e. \\(\\frac{FP}{TP+FP}\\). Benjamini-Hochberg’s method control the FDR level, \\(\\gamma\\), when performing \\(m\\) independent tests, as follows: Sort the p-values \\(p_1 \\leq p_2 \\leq \\dots \\leq p_m\\). Find the maximum \\(j\\) such that \\(p_j \\leq \\gamma \\frac{j}{m}\\). Declare significance for all tests \\(1, 2, \\dots, j\\). 4.4.4 ‘Adjusted’ p-values Sometimes an adjusted significance threshold is not reported, but instead ‘adjusted’ p-values are reported. Using Bonferroni’s method the ‘adjusted’ p-values are: \\(\\tilde p_i = \\min(m p_i, 1)\\). A feature’s adjusted p-value represents the smallest FWER at which the null hypothesis will be rejected, i.e. the feature will be deemed significant. Benjamini-Hochberg’s ‘adjusted’ p-values are called \\(q\\)-values: \\(q_i = \\min(\\frac{m}{i} p_i, 1)\\) A feature’s \\(q\\)-value can be interpreted as the lowest FDR at which the corresponding null hypothesis will be rejected, i.e. the feature will be deemed significant.
