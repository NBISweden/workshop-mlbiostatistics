Linear model does not fit the data well in this case 1.2 Logistic regression Yanny or Laurel auditory illusion appeared online in May 2018. You could find lots of information about it, together with some plausible explanations why some people hear Yanny and some year Laurel One of the explanation is that with age we lose the ability to hear certain sounds To see if there is evidence for that, someone has already collected some data for 53 people including their age and gender # Read in and preview data yl &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/lm/yanny-laurel.csv&quot;) head(yl) ## hear age gender ## 1 Yanny 40 Female ## 2 Yanny 48 Male ## 3 Yanny 32 Female ## 4 Laurel 47 Female ## 5 Laurel 60 Male ## 6 Yanny 11 Female # Recode Laurel to 0 and Yanny as 1 in new variable yl$word &lt;- 0 yl$word[yl$hear==&quot;Yanny&quot;] &lt;- 1 # Make some exploratory plots par(mfrow=c(1,2)) plot(yl$age, yl$word, pch=19, xlab=&quot;age&quot;, ylab=&quot;&quot;, las=1) boxplot(yl$age~yl$hear, xlab=&quot;&quot;, ylab=&quot;age&quot;, col=&quot;lightblue&quot;) Figure 1.2: Yanny and Laurel auditory illusion data, Yanny (1), Laurel (0) Since the response variable takes only two values (Yanny or Laurel) we use GLM model to fit logistic regression model for the probability of hearing Yanny we let \\(p_i=P(Y_i=1)\\) denote the probability of hearing Yanny (success) and we assume that the response follows binomial distribution: \\(Y_i \\sim Bi(1, p_i)\\) distribution We can write the regression model now as: \\[log(\\frac{p_i}{1-p_i})=\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_i\\] and given the properties of logarithms this is also equivalent to: \\[p_i = \\frac{exp(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_i)}{1 + exp(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_i)}\\] In essence, the GLM generalizes linear regression by allowing the linear model to be related to the response variable via a link function. Here, the link function \\(log(\\frac{p_i}{1-p_i})\\) provides the link between the binomial distribution of \\(Y_i\\) (hearing Yanny) the linear predictor (age) Thus GLM model can be written as \\[g(\\mu_i)=\\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol\\beta\\] where g() is the link function.

Regression lines in males and femals are very alike and the model suggest no gender effect 1.3 Poisson regression GLMs can be also applied to count data e.g. hospital admissions due to respiratory disease or number of bird nests in a certain habitat here, we commonly assume that data follow the Poisson distribution \\(Y_i \\sim Pois(\\mu_i)\\) and the corresponding model is \\[E(Y_i)=\\mu_i = \\eta_ie^{\\mathbf{x_i}^T\\boldsymbol\\beta}\\] with a log link \\(\\ln\\mu_i = \\ln \\eta_i + \\mathbf{x_i}^T\\boldsymbol\\beta\\) Data set Suppose we wish to model \\(Y_i\\) the number of cancer cases in the i-th intermediate geographical location (IG) in Glasgow. We have collected data for 271 regions, a small areas that contain between 2500 and 6000 people.

What might affect the chance of getting a heart disease? One of the earliest studies addressing this issue started in 1960 in 3154 healthy men in the San Francisco area. At the start of the study all were free of heart disease. Eight years later the study recorded whether these men now suffered from heart disease (chd), along with many other variables that might be related. The data is available from the faraway package and includes variables: age: age in years height: height in inches weight: weight in pounds sdp: systolic blood pressure in mm Hg dbp: diastolic blood pressure in mm Hg chol: Fasting serum cholesterol in mm % behave: behavior type which is a factor with levels A1 A2 B3 B4 cigs: number of cigarettes smoked per day dibep: behavior type a factor with levels A (Agressive) B (Passive) chd: coronary heat disease developed is a factor with levels no yes typechd: type of coronary heart disease is a factor with levels angina infdeath none silent timechd: Time of CHD event or end of follow-up arcus: arcus senilis is a factor with levels absent present using logistic regression, can you discover anything interesting about the probability of developing heart disease (chd)? using Poisson regression, can you comment about the numbers of cigarettes smoked (cigs)? library(faraway) data(wcgs, package=&quot;faraway&quot;) head(wcgs) ## age height weight sdp dbp chol behave cigs dibep chd typechd timechd ## 2001 49 73 150 110 76 225 A2 25 B no none 1664 ## 2002 42 70 160 154 84 177 A2 20 B no none 3071 ## 2003 42 69 160 110 78 181 B3 0 A no none 3071 ## 2004 41 68 152 124 78 132 B4 20 A no none 3064 ## 2005 59 70 150 144 86 255 B3 20 A yes infdeath 1885 ## 2006 44 72 204 150 90 182 B4 0 A no none 3102 ## arcus ## 2001 absent ## 2002 present ## 2003 absent ## 2004 absent ## 2005 present ## 2006 absent Answers to selected exercises Exr. 1.2 possible solution probability of developing heart disease We first check the relationship between variables to gain more understanding of the data.
