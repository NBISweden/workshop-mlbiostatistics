# Tidymodels

We have seen that there are many common steps when using supervised learning for prediction, such as data splitting and parameters tuning. Over the years, some initiatives were taken to create a common framework for the machine learning tasks in R. A while back Max Kuhn was the main developer behind a popular `caret` package that among others enabled feature engineering and control of training parameters like cross-validation. In 2020 `tidymodels`framework was introduced as a collection of R packages for modeling and machine learning using tidyverse principles, under a guidance of Max Kuhn and Hadley Wickham, author of `tidyverse` package.
