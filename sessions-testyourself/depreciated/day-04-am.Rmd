## Welcome to Thursday! 

1. Take a minute to look at [today's questions](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdc6IjYQPBCSnzrpqrW6dgeeLS1dckhYYZhZpEkj10UrIacKw/viewform?usp=sf_link) and rate your knowledge
2. Then, in your group discuss:
- yesterday's questions (below); can you agree on the answers?
- anything that you've found confusing or useful yesterday
- and post your answers and comments on our [whiteboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/15oxwIUbheZfNQMc82B4phuRVr3R4GeOvsxyKrvZ4sR0/edit?usp=sharing)

**Wednesday's questions**

1. Given a linear model $Y_i=\alpha + \beta x_i + \epsilon_i$ what terminology is used for $Y$ and $x$?
- $Y$ is called outcome, response and independent variable
- $x$ is called exposure, predictor or dependent variable
- $Y$ is called outcome, response, dependent variable
- $x$ is called outcome, response, dependent variable


2. Given a linear model $Y_i=\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \beta_2 x_i^2 + \epsilon_i$ what is the design matrix ?

a) $\begin{bmatrix} 1 & x_1  \\ 1 & x_2  \\ \vdots & \vdots \\ 1 & x_{n} \end{bmatrix}$ b) $\begin{bmatrix} 1 & x_1 & x_2  \\ 1 & x_2 & x_2 \\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\1 & x_n & x_{n}\end{bmatrix}$ c) $\begin{bmatrix} 1 & x_{1,1} & x_{1,2}  \\ 1 & x_{2,1} & x_{2,2} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\ 1 & x_{1,n} & x_{n,2} \end{bmatrix}$ d) $\begin{bmatrix} 1 & x_{1,1} & x_{1,2}^2  \\ 1 & x_{2,1} & x_{2,2}^2 \\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\ 1 & x_{1,n} & x_{n,2}^2 \end{bmatrix}$

 
3. Given output of lm() regression  what is true based on the slope coefficient?
```{r, echo=F}
weight <- c(58, 70, 74, 63.5, 62.0, 70.5, 71.0, 66.0, 80) # body weight (kg)
plasma <- c(2.75, 2.86, 3.37, 2.76, 2.62, 3.49, 3.05, 3.12, 4) # plasma volume (liters)
gender <- c("Female", "Male", "Female", "Female", "Male", "Male", "Female", "Male", "Male")

#summary(lm(plasma ~ weight))
```

```{r}
