##### <img border="0" src="icons/info.svg" width="40" height="40"> Introduction to biostatistics and machine learning
This is a generic website containing teaching and learning materials used during the "Introduction to biostatistics and machine learning" course organised by NBIS, National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden. The course is open for PhD students, postdocs, researchers and other employees in need of biostatistical skills within all Swedish universities. The materials are geared towards life scientists wanting to be able to understand and use basic statistical and machine learning methods.

The course is run via Canvas and is advertised via SciLifeLab website [https://www.scilifelab.se/events/#calendar](https://www.scilifelab.se/events/#calendar) and [NBIS website](https://nbis.se/training/events.html).

The latest Canvas course is here: [https://uppsala.instructure.com/courses/74597](https://uppsala.instructure.com/courses/74597).

- Basic R programming skills
- BYOL (bring your own laptop) with R and RStudio installed
- No prior biostatistical knowledge is assumed

<br/>

##### <img border="0" src="icons/selection.svg" width="40" height="40"> Selection criteria
 - The course can accommodate maximum of 25 participants. If we receive more applications, participants will be selected based on several criteria. Selection criteria include correct entry requirements, motivation to attend the course as well as gender and geographical balance.
 - NBIS prioritises academic participants (students, staff, affiliated researchers) in Sweden. We can accept participants from industry and/or outside Sweden if we have seats available and the requirements criteria are met.

- Upon successful course completion, assessed based on active participation in all course session, we will issue a course certificate.

- Please note that we are **not** able to provide any formal university credits (högskolepoäng). Many universities, however, recognize the attendance in our courses, and award 1.5 HPs, corresponding to 40 h of studying. It is up to participants to clarify and arrange credit transfer with the relevant university department.
