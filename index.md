title:  'Introduction to biostatistics and machine learning'

##### <img border="0" src="icons/info.svg" width="40" height="40"> Introduction to biostatistics and machine learning
National course open for PhD students, postdocs, researchers and other employees in need of biostatistical skills within all Swedish universities.  The course is geared towards life scientists wanting to be able to understand and use basic statistical and machine learning methods. It would also suit those already applying biostatistical methods but have never got a chance to reflect on and truly grasp the basic statistical concepts, such as the commonly misinterpreted p-value.

##### <img border="0" src="icons/education.svg" width="40" height="40"> Education
In this course we focus on an active learning approach. The course participants are expected to do some pre-course reading and exercises, corresponding up to 40h studying. The education consists of teaching blocks alternating between mini-lectures, group discussions, live coding sessions etc. A special focus is put on understanding basic concepts by solving problems with pen and paper.

##### <img border="0" src="icons/enter.svg" width="40" height="40"> Entry requirements
- No prior biostatistical knowledge is assumed
- BYOL (bring your own laptop) with R and RStudio installed

<br/>

##### <img border="0" src="icons/selection.svg" width="40" height="40"> Selection criteria
 - Due to limited space the course can accommodate maximum of 25 participants. If we receive more applications, participants will be selected based on several criteria. Selection criteria include correct entry requirements, motivation to attend the course as well as gender and geographical balance.
 - NBIS prioritises academic participants (students, staff, affiliated researchers) in Sweden. We can accept participants from industry and/or outside Sweden if we have seats available and the requirements criteria are met.

- Upon successful course completion, assessed based on active participation in all course session, we will issue a course certificate.

- Please note that we are **not** able to provide any formal university credits (högskolepoäng). Many universities, however, recognize the attendance in our courses, and award 1.5 HPs, corresponding to 40 h of studying. It is up to participants to clarify and arrange credit transfer with the relevant university department.
