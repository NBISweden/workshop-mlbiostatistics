This directory contains files to control software environment during exercises
for all chapters.

A convenient way to restore the R environment stored in the files is using
`conda` with the command below.

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

The environment can be restored by manual installation of the packages listed in
`R-packages.txt`.
