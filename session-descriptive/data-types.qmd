# Data types

Data can be divided into different types. We differentiate between categorical (qualitative) and numerical (quantitative) data types.

**Categorical data types are further divided into:**

- **Nominal**: named, categories are mutually exclusive and unordered
  - *e.g.dead/alive, healthy/sick, WT/mutant, blood group (A/B/ABO/O), male/female, red/green/blue*
- **Ordinal:** named and ordered, categories are mutually exclusive and ordered
  - *e.g. pain (weak, moderate, severe), AA/Aa/aa, very young/young/middle age/old/very old, grade I, II, III, IV*

**Numerical data types are further divided into:**

- **Discrete**: finite or countable infinite values
  - *e.g. days sick last year, number of cells, number of reads*
- **Continuous**: infinitely many uncountable values
  - *e.g. height, weight, concentration*

Depending on the data type we use different methods to describe, summarize and visualize the data. 
Beyond descriptive statistics, we even use different methods to analyse the data.
