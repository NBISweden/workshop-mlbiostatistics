Two main types of statistics are **descriptive** and **inferential** statistics. **Descriptive statistics** describes and summarizes the data (sample) whereas **inferential statistics** uses a sample of data to learn about the population that the sample of data is thought to represent. \n\n\n::: {.cell .fig-cap-location-margin layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Illustration of two main types of statistics.

Assuming our research group is a representative sample of larger population of research groups, using statistical inference we can ask and answer questions such as what percentage of researches usually drive to work? \n\n### Descriptive statistics {-}\nIn other words, a descriptive statistic is a summary statistics that quantitatively describes features of collected information, e.g. percentage of our research group who walked to work on Monday. Descriptive statistics uses and analyses these statistics to help us to understand the data by: \n\n-   describing the data\n-   visualizing the data\n-   summarizing the data\n\nDescriptive statistics is also used to:\n\n-   uncover potential patterns in the data including outliers\n-   and guide down-stream analysis\n",
