Similar to mean, it can be a misleading measure if there are outliers in the data. \n\nGiven our age values the range can be calculated: \n```{r}\n#| code-fold: false\n\nage_max <- data_diabetes %$%\n  max(age)\n\nage_min <- data_diabetes %$%\n  min(age)\n\nrange <- age_max - age_min\nprint(range)\n  \n```\n\n\n## Quartiles \n\nIf we arrange the data in order of magnitude, starting with the smallest and ending with the largest value we can define percentiles. The value of $x$ that has 1% of the observations in the ordered set lying below it (and 99% of the observations lying above it) is called the 1st **percentile**. The value of $x$ that has 2% of the observations in the ordered set lying below it (and 98% of the observations lying above it) is called the 2nd percentile, and so on. The values of $x$ that divide the ordered set into 10 equally sized groups, that is the 10th, 20th, 30th, ..., 90th percentiles, are called **deciles**.\n\n**Quartiles** are the **three values** that divide the data values into **four equally sized groups**.\n\n  - **Q1**. Lower quartile. 25% of values are below Q1. Divides the values below the median into equally sized groups.\n  - **Q2**. **Median**. 50% of values are below Q2 and 50% are above Q2. Q2 is the median that we have seen before.\n  - **Q3**. Upper quartile. 75% of values are below Q3. Divides the values above the median into equally sized groups.\n\nGoing back to the diabetes data set, what are the three quartiles of participants age?\n\n```{r}\n#| collapse: true\n#| code-fold: false\n\n# calculate quartiles\nquartiles <- data_diabetes %>%\n  reframe(x = quantile(age, c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75))) \n\nQ1 <- quartiles %>% slice(1) %>% pull(x)\nQ2 <- quartiles %>% slice(2) %>% pull(x)\nQ3 <- quartiles %>% slice(3) %>% pull(x)\n\nprint(Q1)\nprint(Q2)\nprint(Q3)\n```\n\n## IQR\nThe **interquartile range**, IQR, is the difference between the 1st (Q1) and the 3rd (Q3) quartiles, i.e. between the 25th and 75th percentiles. It contains the central 50% of the observations in the ordered set.\n\n$$IQR = Q3 - Q1$$\n\nFor instance, the IQR range for age value for our study is: \n```{r}\n#| code-fold: false\niqr = Q3 - Q1\nprint(iqr)\n```\n\n\n\n## Variance and standard deviation\n\nThe **variance** of a set of observations is their mean squared distance from the mean value:\n\n$$\\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar x)^2.$$ {#eq-sigma2}\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-var\n#| fig-cap: First ten age measurements for the study participants.

Another common measure using the same unit as $x$ is **standard deviation**, defined as the square root of the variance:\n\n$$\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar x)^2}$$ {#eq-sigma}\n\nTypically, we regard the collection of observations $x_1, \\dots, x_n$ as a **sample** drawn from a large **population** of possible observations. It has been shown theoretically that we obtain a better sample estimate of the population variance and standard deviation if we divide by $(n-1)$. So the denominator $n$ is commonly replaced by $n-1$ and the **sample variance** is calculated instead as \n\n$$s^2 = {\\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar x)^2}.$$ {#eq-s2}\n\nand the **sample standard deviation** is calculated as:\n\n$$s = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar x)^2}.$$ {#eq-s}\n\nTo reiterate:\n\n- we calculate standard deviation, $\\sigma$, when we consider our observations to be entire population (@eq-sigma)\n- we calculate sample standard deviation, $s$, when we consider our observations a random sample from a larger population, as a better estimate of the standard deviation of the larger population (@eq-s)\n\nLet's calculate variance, standard deviation and sample standard deviation for `age`.\n```{r}\n#| collapse: true\n#| code-fold: false\n# extract age values\nage <- data_diabetes %>% pull(age)\n\n# number of observations\nn <- length(age)\n\n# calculate mean (arithmetic)\nage_mean <- mean(age)\n\n# calculate variance following variance equation\nsigma2 <- (sum((age - age_mean)^2))/(n)\n\n# calculate standard deviation following standard deviation equation\nsigma <- sqrt((sum((age - age_mean)^2))/(n))\n\n# calculate sample variance following sample variance equation\ns2 <- (sum((age - age_mean)^2))/(n-1)\n\n# calculate sample standard deviation following sample standard deviation equation\ns <- sqrt((sum((age - age_mean)^2))/(n-1))\n\n# collect results\nv.name <- c(\"sigma2\", \"sigma\", \"s2\", \"s\")\nv.values <- c(sigma2, sigma, s2, s)\nresults <- data.frame(stats = v.name, value = v.values)\nprint(results)\n\n```\n\nWe can check our calculations of sample variance and sample standard deviation using `R` functions `var()` and `sd()`\n```{r}\n#| collapse: true\n#| code-fold: false\n\nprint(var(age))\nprint(sd(age))\n\n```\n\n## Other measures\n\nThere are naturally additional measure of spread and to assess the shape of data distribution. Some examples include the **Coefficient of Variation (CV)**, calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean. CV is commonly used to compare the variability of measurements across different groups or conditions in biological experiments, regardless of their units. The **Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)** measures average deviation from the mean, offering a robust alternative to the standard deviation, particularly useful in studies with outliers, such as enzyme kinetics where reaction rates can vary widely. **Skewness** measures the asymmetry of a distribution around its mean, important in clinical data to determine if results are biased toward high or low values, which might indicate non-normal behavior like skewed immune response. **Kurtosis** evaluates the 'tailedness' of the distribution; in pharmacological data, high kurtosis might suggest a concentration of data around a mean with extreme outliers, indicative of varying drug responses among patients.\n\n**Coefficient of Variation (CV)**\n$$\\text{CV} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\mu} \\times 100\\%$$\nHere, $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation and $\\mu$ is the mean of the dataset. The CV is expressed as a percentage to indicate the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean.\n\n**Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)**\n$$\\text{MAD} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - \\mu|$$\nThis represents the average of the absolute differences between each data point $x_i$ and the mean $\\mu$ of the dataset, where $n$ is the number of observations.\n\n**Skewness**\n$$\\text{Skewness} = \\frac{n}{(n-1)(n-2)} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left(\\frac{x_i - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^3$$\nSkewness measures the asymmetry of the data around the mean. Positive skew indicates a tail on the right side of the distribution, and negative skew indicates a tail on the left.\n\n**Kurtosis**\n$$\\text{Kurtosis} = \\frac{n(n+1)}{(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left(\\frac{x_i - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^4 - \\frac{3(n-1)^2}{(n-2)(n-3)}$$\nKurtosis assesses the tailedness of the distribution. A higher kurtosis than the normal distribution (which has a kurtosis of 3) indicates a distribution with more pronounced tails.\n\n\n\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n# Measures of spread\n```{r}\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\n\n# load libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(magrittr)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(faraway)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\n\n# define generic ggplot theme\nfont.size <- 12\ncol.blue.light <- \"#a6cee3\"\ncol.blue.dark <- \"#1f78b4\"\nmy.ggtheme <- theme(axis.title = element_text(size = font.size), \n        axis.text = element_text(size = font.size), \n        legend.text = element_text(size = font.size), \n        legend.title = element_blank(), \n        legend.position = \"top\", \n        axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0)) \n\n# add obesity and diabetes status to diabetes faraway data\ninch2m <- 2.54/100\npound2kg <- 0.45\ndata_diabetes <- diabetes %>%\n  mutate(height  = height * inch2m, height = round(height, 2)) %>% \n  mutate(waist = waist * inch2m) %>%  \n  mutate(weight = weight * pound2kg, weight = round(weight, 2)) %>%\n  mutate(BMI = weight / height^2, BMI = round(BMI, 2)) %>% \n  mutate(obese= cut(BMI, breaks = c(0, 29.9, 100), labels = c(\"No\", \"Yes\"))) %>% \n  mutate(diabetic = ifelse(glyhb > 7, \"Yes\", \"No\"), diabetic = factor(diabetic, levels = c(\"No\", \"Yes\"))) %>%\n  na.omit()\n```\n\n## Range\nThe **range** is the difference between the largest and the smallest observations in the data set.
