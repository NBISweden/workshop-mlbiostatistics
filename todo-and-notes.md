## ToDo

Main

- select students and notify the accepted and non-accepted (Eva, Olga)
- adjust pre-course, add R section? Move some of the probability theory? (Olga, Eva)
- set-up Zoom link
- decide how to take questions from students: Zoom, Zulip, Canvas, other?
- email out instruction on how to join and pre-course link
- find TAs
- go through materials and exercises (all)
- have basic Canvas functionality (Eva, Olga, all)
- add daily quizzes to Canvas (Olga)
- check schedule (all)
- decide groups
- decide how to run things, like before from Uppsala or all online?


Content specific

- update "Welcome session" with 2021 graph (Olga)
- check "Intro lecture" (Bengt)
- check "Mathematical Foundation" team session (Olga)
- check "Daily challenges": have solutions and answers ready (all)
- check "Probability and Simulations I, II" (mistakes, solutions, add/remove content, add label "supplementary" exercise(s))(Eva, Olga, TAs)
- check "Descriptive stats" (Eva, Olga, TAs)
- check "Hypothesis testing I, II, III" (Eva, Olga, TAs)
- check "Linear models" sections (mistakes, solutions, add/remove content, add label "supplementary" exercise(s))(Olga, Eva, TAs)
- check "PCA" session (Payam, Olga, TAs): add solutions and/or more exercises?
- check "Clustering" session (Eva, Olga, TAs)
- replace "Classification" with "Classification and model evaluation session" or "Supervised learning: classification and model evaluation" (Olga, Eva, TAs)
- check "Regularization" session (Bengt, Olga, TAs)
- add "Random Forest" (Payam? Olga?)
- check course feedback (Olga, Eva)



## From 2020
Content

- overall: go through materials with fresh eyes, make sure we have all solutions
- improve? daily questions? Leave some mistakes on purpose to get the discussion going?
- Olga: add correct Gini index equation and example to decision tree
- add binomial to pre-course
- move more of the probability to the course?
- add some basic R tutorial (see what we are covering and make exercises for that)
- add finding the best number of clusters in k-means
- suggestion from a student: start each session with why we are learning a thing (biological example) and then go into how.

Content adjustments

- more time to go through each individual thing
- free up some time
- move probability to pre-course
- write course specific R tutorial
- ANOVA, F-test?
- decision trees - expand to random forest
- remove ANN?
- add PLS
- add derivation of least squares as supplementary to linear models
- add multi-categorical logistic regression example (extra reading)
- add mixed effect models example (extra reading)
- add at the end of chapters: similar methods, methods extensions, i.e. where to go next
- same dataset throughout the week? make up one with toxicity levels, gene expression response, 2 groups, count data of number of mutations
- pipeline of analysis: data cleaning, data exploration and then biostatistics and machine learning  
- p-value of the lm model

## Select students a bit better
- it is introductory course

## Running things on Zoom
- room camera for exercises
- spotlight on host for live streaming
- find a good annotation tool
- activate students: get them to answer and ask questions
