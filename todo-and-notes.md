## ToDo

Main

- select students and notify the accepted and non-accepted (Eva, Olga)
- select few for the waiting list (Eva)
- notify the ones on the waiting list (after September 2nd) (Eva)
- make a final list of students (Olga, Eva)
- send the students list with invoice information to Jessica Lindberg to add students to Canvas. From NBIS_DEMO instructions: "Upon acceptance to the course, the students will be added by the email that was provided in their application form. This will be done by Jessica Lindberg upon your sending your accepted list of participants and respective invoicing information."
- decide student groups (4 or 5)

- set-up and check Zoom link (Olga, Eva)
- figure out how we add students to Canvas:
- check pre-course materials, add links to Canvas
- email out "pre-course" materials and how to join the course (Zoom, Canvas)

- find more TAs (in progress)


- have basic Canvas functionality (Eva, Olga, all)
- figure out Canvas chat & discussion: taking questions
- go through materials and exercises (all)
- add daily quizzes to Canvas (Olga)


Content specific

- update "Welcome session" with 2021 graph (Olga)
- check "Intro lecture" (Bengt)
- check "Mathematical Foundation" team session (Olga)
- check "Daily challenges": have solutions and answers ready (all)
- check "Probability and Simulations I, II" (mistakes, solutions, add/remove content, add label "supplementary" exercise(s))(Eva, Olga, TAs)
- check "Descriptive stats" (Eva, Olga, TAs)
- check "Hypothesis testing I, II, III" (Eva, Olga, TAs)
- check "Linear models" sections (mistakes, solutions, add/remove content, add label "supplementary" exercise(s))(Olga, Eva, TAs)
- check "PCA" session (Payam, Olga, TAs): add solutions and/or more exercises?
- check "Clustering" session (Eva, Olga, TAs)
- replace "Classification" with "Classification and model evaluation session" or "Supervised learning: classification and model evaluation" (Olga, Eva, TAs)
- check "Regularization" session (Bengt, Olga, TAs)
- add "Random Forest" (Payam? Olga?)
- check course feedback (Olga, Eva)

## Zoom link
-


## Take with to Uppsala
- backup conference camera from G7 (booked)
- Bose microphone/speaker
- screen, keyboard, trackpad
- camera



## From 2020
Content

- improve? daily questions? Leave some mistakes on purpose to get the discussion going?
- Olga: add correct Gini index equation and example to decision tree
- add binomial to pre-course
- move more of the probability to the course?
- add some basic R tutorial (see what we are covering and make exercises for that)
- add finding the best number of clusters in k-means
- suggestion from a student: start each session with why we are learning a thing (biological example) and then go into how.

Content adjustments

- more time to go through each individual thing
- free up some time
- move probability to pre-course
- write course specific R tutorial
- ANOVA, F-test?
- decision trees - expand to random forest
- remove ANN?
- add PLS
- add derivation of least squares as supplementary to linear models
- add multi-categorical logistic regression example (extra reading)
- add mixed effect models example (extra reading)
- add at the end of chapters: similar methods, methods extensions, i.e. where to go next
- same dataset throughout the week? make up one with toxicity levels, gene expression response, 2 groups, count data of number of mutations
- pipeline of analysis: data cleaning, data exploration and then biostatistics and machine learning  
- p-value of the lm model

## Select students a bit better
- it is introductory course

## Running things on Zoom
- room camera for exercises
- spotlight on host for live streaming
- find a good annotation tool
- activate students: get them to answer and ask questions


# For 2022
- add pre-course R exercises tailored for the course
