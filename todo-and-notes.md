## ToDo (2022)

**Admin**
- sort out final students list and invoice information (send to JL)
- add students to Canvas
- put students in groups (find group names)
- order lunches and fika
- make door sign
- prepare attendance lists
- prepare certificates
- prepare short-term feedback survey

**Content**
- finalise and email out pre-course (make Canvas quiz)
- finalise schedule and content


### From 2021-10
Suggestions and ideas as collected throughout the course

Mathematical foundations:
- fix bugs with preliminary math (per emails)
- Mathematical foundations: spell out questions and have solutions ready
- Define better finding subset of D, confusing to some students
- Solutions to exercises: to show students later on
- Go through materials and check what equations we are using
- Do some practice with more notations of average etc.
- Instead of submitting the work: do multiple attempt quiz to students can get whether they will be able to follow the course

Descriptive stats
- Add questions to make students think
- a) think of robot measure of spread: MAD
- b) mean vs.  median -> transformations
- c) why do we even do descriptive stats

Probability
- Check notations
- Add contingency table next to hypergeometric distribution

Statistical inference:
- add more tests like ANOVA and non-parametric

Linear models:
- Better examples to show that linear models can be quite complex, non-linear in relationships (now only having equations)
- Better example to introduce interaction terms than “height, weight, gender”
- Better examples of violation of model assumptions
- Exercises: there is one bug with hypothesis testing
- Do one demo with deriving coefficients from theorem, matrix form and lm; include also grouping when showing matrix solution
- Check the trout exercises again
- height, weight examples: change to cm and kg: or even better, to a different data set
- read Irizarry chapter re model matrix; include model.matrix() in demo
- add multi-categorical logistic regression example (extra reading)
- add mixed effect models example (extra reading)

GLM
- Introduce logistic and have a table of other ones
- Move Poisson to exercises: use the same Species data

Introduction to supervised learning
- Do example on only two variables of iris data set to be able to show the classification rate plot for different k with observations
- Include k-folds split and LOOCV example in exercises
- Reiterate how fitting a model is: give examples of other parameters tuning, e.g. in Random Forest, Neural Networks etc.

Generic comments:
- If online make sure we check active participation
- Daily quizzes: check questions and answers; prepare pdf. with solutions
- Course-wrap up sessions: what’s beyond i.e. different methods  
- For each chapter: point to other methods and explain briefly what’s the difference (extension etc.), e.g linear mixed effect models, PCA -> ICC, t-SNE etc.
- think if we can have more biological examples to put every session  even more in the context

- prepare R notebooks
- prepare list of R packages to install up front

Future best set-up?
- Online pre-course session
- Physical course
- Online follow-up


## Take with to Uppsala
- backup conference camera from G7 (if run online, book camera ahead)
- Bose microphone/speaker
- screen, keyboard, trackpad
- camera

## Running things on Zoom
- room camera for exercises
- spotlight on host for live streaming
- find a good annotation tool
- activate students: get them to answer and ask questions
