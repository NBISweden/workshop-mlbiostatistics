## Notes from 2022-09

**Overall**
- Make it less to be more!
- Next course: a year is too much of a gap
- Provide skeleton files for exercises: quatro
- Change installation instructions to quatro
- Welcome slide: variance typo, missing ^2 in the last exercise slide
- Discuss how to have things rendered together on Github
- Add "beyond" text to every chapter e.g. linear mixed effect models, PCA -> ICC, t-SNE etc.


**Pre-course: Mathematical foundations**
- go through course content and adjust so there is a better match
- make a better quiz for people to practice
- write down solution to exercises on Canvas (open at the course start)
- give students homework that is directly linked to materials during the week
- fix typos as per Jonas's emails

**Pre-course: R skills**
- move instructions and have examples of .qmd
- go through course content and list what skills are needed
- design some exercises to practice these skills and a test so they can judge; maybe already introduce a biological data that are to be analysed during the course

**Welcome slides**
 - Add vision for the course to welcome slides and course announcements

**Descriptive stats**
- Potential group discussion points:
  - a) think of robot measure of spread: MAD
  - b) mean vs.  median -> transformations
  - c) why do we even do descriptive stats
- Now people seemed like to box plot exercise on the whiteboard
- Mention where descriptive stats fall inside the data analyses process, add a little bit on data cleaning, missing values, outliers etc.
- Add R basic code?
- Add a picture of histogram with median, mean (arithmetic and geometric), mode
- Add a note on geometric mean?
- Add a note on mean vs. median on skewed distributions (during lecture, whiteboard?)
- Play with the presentation so the data types diagram flows better between the slides?
- Prepare a more complex example .qmd file with EDA (and show it during the presentation)?

**Probability & Inference**
- Stop at the experimental design? Exclude sample proportion?
- Brainstorm  how to to make this part more likeable
- Doing it together somehow? Shall I do the intro? And/or intermittent check-ups?
- Restructure so that we teach resampling, parametric and non-parametric side by side? Restructure / rethink exercises so that we make sure that people get hypothesis testing? Include categorical tests?
- Do we want to keep non-parametric methods separate?

**Non-parametric tests**
- Add paired t-test to chapter
- Use sign test, Wilxocon sign test in non-parametric methods
- Use the same example across: resampling, parametric and non-parametric methods
- Read more about the CI estimates and functions in R
- Improve exercises and add (next round)
- Add more on sign test (next round)
- Fix “weight” spelling (next round)
- Add examples on Kruskal-Wallis  (next round)
- Shiny app / Python app to demonstrate W distribution and associated p-values?
- Visualisation of Kendal tau? (next round)
- Tie the session better to Eva’s, follow the same notations? Do a mini revision


**Linear models**
- add equation of the straight line to pre-course math
- better examples to show that linear models can be quite complex
- better examples for coefficients, change units into metric, show interactions
- better examples of model assumptions and violation
- more about model matrix
- mention beyond: mixed effect models (maybe write a short intro one day)
- fix typos as per Jonas's email

**PCA**
- Maybe add covariance matrix already in the precourse
- Talk correlation and covariance before, maybe in linear models
- Make it easier to understand eigenvectors and eigenvalues  

**Clustering**
- Better questions and examples for the quiz
- What are the teaching goals here?

**Introduction to supervised learning**
- Link to scikit-learn main website of main machine learning application and highlight where all these methods fall so it does not feel that biostats and ML are two different words and we focus only last two days on ML
- Highlight that regression, logistic regression, GLM, feature selection are all part of it
- Have an overview slide when talking about supervised learning
- Doing coding demo is important, maybe should win with doing KNN on the whiteboard


**Daily quizzes**
- check questions and answers but in principle redesign them to reiterate the message of the day
- maybe even have more questions to practice, pool of questions?
- prepare .pdfs with solutions

**Wrap-up slides**
- make some pointing to what's beyond a little bit better
- for each chapter: point to other methods and explain

**Generic**
- briefly what’s the difference (extension etc.), e.g linear mixed effect models, PCA -> ICC, t-SNE etc.

**Potentially useful**
A framework for feature selection in clustering

### From 2021-10

Probability
- Check notations
- Add contingency table next to hypergeometric distribution

Statistical inference:
- add more tests like ANOVA and non-parametric

Linear models:
- Better examples to show that linear models can be quite complex, non-linear in relationships (now only having equations)
- Better example to introduce interaction terms than “height, weight, gender”
- Better examples of violation of model assumptions
- Exercises: there is one bug with hypothesis testing
- Do one demo with deriving coefficients from theorem, matrix form and lm; include also grouping when showing matrix solution
- Check the trout exercises again
- height, weight examples: change to cm and kg: or even better, to a different data set
- read Irizarry chapter re model matrix; include model.matrix() in demo
- add multi-categorical logistic regression example (extra reading)
- add mixed effect models example (extra reading)


Generic comments:
- If online make sure we check active participation
- Daily quizzes: check questions and answers; prepare pdf. with solutions
- Course-wrap up sessions: what’s beyond i.e. different methods  
- For each chapter: point to other methods and explain briefly what’s the difference (extension etc.), e.g linear mixed effect models, PCA -> ICC, t-SNE etc.
- think if we can have more biological examples to put every session  even more in the context

- prepare R notebooks
- prepare list of R packages to install up front

## Future best set-up
- Online pre-course session
- Physical course
- Online follow-up


## Take with to Uppsala
- computer charger that fits into sockets
- backup conference camera from G7 (if run online, book camera ahead)
- Bose microphone/speaker
- screen, keyboard, trackpad
- camera

## Running things on Zoom
- room camera for exercises
- spotlight on host for live streaming
- find a good annotation tool
- activate students: get them to answer and ask questions
