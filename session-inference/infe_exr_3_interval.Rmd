```{exercise, label="CIHb", echo=TRUE}
You measure the Hb value in 10 50-year old men and get the following observations; 145, 165, 134, 167, 158, 176, 156, 189, 143, 123 g/L.

a) Compute a 95% bootstrap interval for the mean Hb value.
b) Compute the sample mean Hb value
c) Compute the sample variance
d) Compute the sample standard deviation
b) Assume that Hb is normally distributed and compute a point estimate and a 95% confidence interval for the mean Hb value.
```



```{exercise, label="CIprop", echo=TRUE}
In the pollen example we calculated a 95% confidence interval.

  a) How can we get a narrower confidence interval?
  b) We computed a 95% interval, what if we want a 90% confidence interval?
  c) or a 99% confidence interval?
```



```{exercise, label="CIscale", echo=TRUE}
A scale has a normally distributed error with mean 0 and standard deviation 2.3 g. You measure an object 10 times and observe the mean weight 43 g.

a) Compute a 95% confidence interval of the objects weight
b) Compute a 90% confidence interval of the objects weight
```


```{exercise, label="BMCsmokers"}
You observe 150 students at BMC of which 25 are smokers. Compute a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of smokers among BMC students.
