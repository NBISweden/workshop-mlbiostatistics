Examples: “The test says that you are covid-19 positive, when you actually are not”, “The test says that the drug has a positive effect on patient symptoms, but it actually has not”.\nType II error is a false negative, a miss that occurs when \\(H_0\\) is accepted, when it is actually false.

The risk of false alarm is controlled by setting the significance level to a desired value. We do want to keep the risk of false alarm (type I error) low, but at the same time we don’t want many missed hits (type II error).\nThe significance level should be set before the hypothesis test is performed. Common values to use are 0.05 or 0.01.\nIf the p-value is above the significance level, \\(p>\\alpha\\), \\(H_0\\) is accepted.\nIf the p-value is below the significance level, \\(p \\leq \\alpha\\), \\(H_0\\) is rejected.\nAnother property of a statistical test is the statistical power, defined as power = P(Reject H0|H0 is false)."

    "text": "1.4 Hypothesis test using resampling\nThe sampling distribution of a test statistic under the null hypothesis is sometimes known or can be approximated. When the null distribution is unknown, another option is to simulate the null distribution using resampling. This is done by simulating a model under the null hypothesis and drawing random samples from this model repeatedly. Let’s take a look at a few examples;\n\n1.4.1 Proportions, pollen allergy example\nLet’s assume we know that the proportion of pollen allergy in Sweden is \\(0.3\\). We suspect that the number of pollen allergic has increased in Uppsala in the last couple of years and want to investigate this.\nObserve 100 people from Uppsala, 42 of these were allergic to pollen. Is there a reason to believe that the proportion of pollen allergic in Uppsala \\(\\pi > 0.3\\)?\n\nNull and alternative hypotheses\n\\(H_0:\\) The proportion of pollen allergy in Uppsala is the same as in Sweden as a whole.\n\\(H_1:\\) The proportion of pollen allergy in Uppsala is greater than in Sweden as a whole.\nor expressed differently;\n\\[H_0:\\, \\pi=\\pi_0\\]\n\\[H_1:\\, \\pi>\\pi_0\\] where \\(\\pi\\) is the unknown proportion of pollen allergy in the Uppsala population and \\(\\pi_0 = 0.3\\) is the proportion of pollen allergy in Sweden.\n\n\nTest statistic\nHere we are interested in the proportion of pollen allergic in Uppsala. An appropriate test statistic could be the number of pollen allergic in a sample of size \\(n=100\\), \\(X\\). As an alternative we can use the proportion of pollen allergic in a sample of size \\(n\\),\n\\[P = \\frac{X}{n}\\]\nLet’s use \\(P\\) as our test statistic and compute the observed value, \\(p_{obs}\\). In our sample of 100 people from Uppsala, the proportion allergic to pollen is \\(p=42/100=0.42\\).\n\n\nNull distribution\nThe sampling distribution of \\(P\\) under \\(H_0\\) (i.e. when the null hypothesis is true) is what we call the null distribution.\n\\(H_0\\) state that \\(\\pi=0.3\\). We can model this using an urn model as follows;\n\n\n\n\n\nAn urn model of the null hypothesis \\(\\pi=0.3\\). The black balls represent allergic and the white balls non-allergic.\n\n\n\n\nUsing this model, we can simulate taking a sample of size 100 many times.\n\n## Urn\nurn <- rep(c(0, 1), c(7, 3))\n## Sample 100 times with replacement\nx <- sample(urn, 100, replace=TRUE)\n## Compute proportion of samples that are allergic (1)\nmean(x)\n\n[1] 0.29\n\n## Set the seed to get the same result if we redo the analysis\nset.seed(13)\n## Repeat drawing sample of size 100 and computing proporion allergic 100000 times\np <- replicate(100000, mean(sample(rep(c(0, 1), c(7, 3)), 100, replace=TRUE)))\n\nPlot the distribution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sampling distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompute p-value\nCompare the observed value, \\(p_{obs} = 0.42\\) to the null distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sampling distribution. The observed value is marked by a red vertical line.\n\n\n\n\nThe p-value is the probability of getting the observed value or higher, if the null hypothesis is true.\nUse the null distribution to calculate the p-value, \\(P(P \\geq 0.42|H_0)\\).\n\n## How many times \nsum(p >= 0.42)\n\n[1] 703\n\n## p-value\npval <- mean(p >= 0.42)\n\np = \\(P(P \\geq 0.42|H_0)\\) = 0.00703\n\n\nAccept or reject \\(H_0\\)?\nAs the p-value is \\(< \\alpha = 0.05\\) the null hypotheis is rejected. This means that we can conclude that there is reason to belive that the porportion of pollen allergic in Uppsala is greater than 30%.\n\n\n\n1.4.2 Mean values, permutation test example\nDo high fat diet lead to increased body weight?\nThe effect of high-fat diet on the body weight of mice is studied in an experiment. The study setup is as follows:\n\n24 female mice are ordered from a lab.\nRandomly, 12 of the 24 mice are assigned to receive high-fat diet, the remaining 12 are controls (ordinary diet).\nBody weight is measured after one week.\n\n\n\n\nThe observed values, mouse weights in grams, are summarized below;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    high-fat \n    25 \n    30 \n    23 \n    18 \n    31 \n    24 \n    39 \n    26 \n    36 \n    29 \n    23 \n    32 \n  \n  \n    ordinary \n    27 \n    25 \n    22 \n    23 \n    25 \n    37 \n    24 \n    26 \n    21 \n    26 \n    30 \n    24 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNull and alternative hypotheses\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nH_0: \\mu_d = \\mu_c \\iff \\mu_d - \\mu_c = 0\\\\\nH_1: \\mu_d>\\mu_c \\iff \\mu_d-\\mu_c > 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mu_d\\) is the (unknown) mean body weight of the high-fat mouse population and \\(\\mu_c\\) is the mean body-weight of the control mouse population.\nStudied population: Female mice that can be ordered from a lab.\n\n\nTest statistic\nHere we are interested in the mean difference between high-fat and control mice and an appropriate test statistic can be the mean diffrence, \\(D = \\bar X_d - \\bar X_c\\), where\n\n\\(\\bar X_d\\) is a random variable describing the mean weight of 12 (randomly selected) mice on high-fat diet. \\(E[\\bar X_d] = E[X_d] = \\mu_d\\)\n\\(\\bar X_c\\) is a random variable describing the Mean weight of 12 (randomly selected) mice on ordinary diet. \\(E[\\bar X_c] = E[X_c] = \\mu_c\\)\n\nThe mean difference \\(D = \\bar X_d - \\bar X_c\\) is also a random variable.\nObserved values;\n\n## 12 HF mice\nxD <- c(25, 30, 23, 18, 31, 24, 39, 26, 36, 29, 23, 32)\n## 12 control mice\nxC <- c(27, 25, 22, 23, 25, 37, 24, 26, 21, 26, 30, 24)\n\n##Compute mean body weights of the two samples\nmD <- mean(xD)\nmC <- mean(xC) \n## Compute mean difference\ndobs <- mD - mC\n\nMean weight of sample control mice (ordinary diet): \\(\\bar x_c = 25.83\\)\nMean weight of sample mice on high-fat diet: \\(\\bar x_d = 28.00\\)\nDifference in sample mean weights: \\(d_{obs} = \\bar x_d - \\bar x_c = 2.1667\\)\n\n\nNull distribution\nIf high-fat diet has no effect, i.e. if \\(H_0\\) was true, the result would be as if all mice were given the same diet. What can we expect if all mice are fed with the same type of food?\nThis can be accomplished using permutation\nThe 24 mice were initially from the same population, depending on how the mice are randomly assigned to high-fat and normal group, the mean weights would differ, even if the two groups were treated the same.\nAssume \\(H_0\\) is true, i.e. assume all mice are equivalent and\n\nRandomly reassign 12 of the 24 mice to ‘high-fat’ and the remaining 12 to ‘control’.\nCompute difference in mean weights\n\nIf we repeat 1-2 many times we get the null distribution of difference in mean weights.\n\n## All 24 body weights in a vector\nx <- c(xHF, xN)\n## Mean difference\ndobs <- mean(x[1:12]) - mean(x[13:24])\n## Permute once\ny <- sample(x)\n##Compute mean difference\nmean(y[1:12]) - mean(y[13:24])\n\n[1] 0.1667\n\n##Repeat the above many times\ndnull.perm <- replicate(n = 100000, {\n  y <- sample(x)\n  ##Mean difference\n  mean(y[1:12]) - mean(y[13:24])\n})\n\nPlot the null distribution and the observed difference.\n\n\n\n\n\nNull distribution of the mean difference \\(D\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompute p-value\nWhat is the probability to get an at least as extreme mean difference as our observed value, \\(d_{obs}\\), if \\(H_0\\) was true?\n\n## Compute the p-value\npval <- mean(dnull.perm>=dobs)\n\n\\[P(\\bar X_2 - \\bar X_1 \\geq d_{obs} | H_0) = 0.169\\]\n\n\nAccept or reject \\(H_0\\)?\nAs \\(0.169>0.05\\) the null hypothesis is accepted, there is no evidence that the high-fat diet increase body weight in mice."

    "text": "4.1 Point estimate\nAs seen in previous chapter, the sample proportion and sample mean are unbiased estimates of the corresponding population statistics. When we only have a sample, the sample estimate will be our best guess, a point estimate, of the population value, but it will not be without error, but the larger the sample, the smaller the error.\nIf we are interested in how large proportion of the Uppsala population is allergic to pollen, we can investigate this by studying a random sample, e.g. randomly select 100 persons in Uppsala. It is important to actually sample randomly, ideally every individual in the population should have the same probability of being sampled.\nIn our sample, we observed that 42 of the 100 has a pollen allergy. Hence, the observed sample proportion is \\(p=0.42\\).\n\nBased on this observation our point estimate of the Uppsala popultation proportion \\(\\pi\\) is \\(\\pi \\approx p = 0.42\\). We know that there is an uncertainty in this measurement, if the experiment is repeated we would select 100 other persons and our point estimate would be slightly different."
