```{exercise, label="pollentest", echo=TRUE}
You believe that the proportion of Swedish students allergic to pollen is greater than 0.3 (the proportion allergic to pollen in Sweden). To test this you observe 20 people in a student group at BMC in Uppsala, 9 or them are allergic to pollen.

Is this reason to believe that the proportion of Swedish students allergic to pollen i greater than 0.3? Perform a hypothesis test to answer the question.

Can you identify any problems with this study setup?

```{exercise, label="diet", echo=TRUE}
A diet study aims to study how the hemoglobin (Hb) levels in blood are affected by an iron-rich diet consisting of tofu, soybeans, broccoli, lentils and peas. To perform the study the dietician has recruited 40 male participants, who are randomly assigned to the iron-rich diet or control group (no change in participants diet), 20 participant in each group.

The observed Hb levels (in g/L);
```

```{r irondiet, echo=TRUE}
ctrl <- c(197, 186, 157, 170, 193, 188, 175, 186, 177, 191, 168, 193, 191, 189, 188, 192, 179, 186, 197, 203)
iron <- c(187, 218, 196, 210, 206, 178, 181, 193, 172, 202, 169, 221, 183, 222, 185, 174, 192, 192, 162, 211)
```

Perform a hypothesis test to investigate if the Hb level is affected (increased or decreased) by the iron-rich diet.
