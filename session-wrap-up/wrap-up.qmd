## Group discussion

<br>

You are a part of research team conducting a lung cancer study. You have collected measurements for 2000 genes for 50 healthy and 50 cancer patients. You also know from previous study that this type of cancer is more likely to occur in older people and in people who smoke, so in addition to gene expression measurements you note down subjects age and smoking status (Yes/No).

Your supervisor knows you are back from the "Introduction to Biostatistics & ML" course and asks you to be in charge of writing a **data analysis** plan to be presented at the next group meeting. How can the methods discussed during the course be used to further understand molecular mechanisms of lung cancer? What analyses will you suggest?

- If you are in [1] use methods from day 1
- If you are in [2] use methods from day 2
- If you are in [3] use methods from day 3
- If you are in [4] use methods from day 4
- If you are in [5] use methods from day 5

## Group discussion

- Think about all the topics we discussed this week. 
- Discuss what you may be still finding unclear or interesting. 
- Come up with at least **at least 2 questions** that you would like to hear answers to.
