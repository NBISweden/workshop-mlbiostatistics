Before making use of a fitted model for explanation or prediction, it is wise to check that the model provides an adequate description of the data. Informally we have been using box plots and scatter plots to look at the data. There are however formal definitions of the assumptions.\n\n**Assumption A: The deterministic part of the model captures all the non-random structure in the data**\n\n- This implies that the **mean of the errors $\\epsilon_i$** is zero.\n- Tt applies only over the range of explanatory variables.\n\n**Assumption B: the scale of variability of the errors is constant at all values of the explanatory variables**\n\n- Practically we are looking at whether the observations are equally spread on both side of the regression line.\n\n**Assumption C: the errors are independent**\n\n- Broadly speaking this means that knowledge of errors attached to one observation does not give us any information about the error attached to another.\n\n**Assumptions D: the errors are normally distributed**\n\n- This will allow us to describe the variation in the model's parameters estimates and therefore make inferences about the population from which our sample was taken.\n\n**Assumption E: the values of the explanatory variables are recorded without error**\n\n- This one is not possible to check via examining the data, instead we have to consider the nature of the experiment.\n\n\n## Checking assumptions\n**Residuals**, $\\hat{\\epsilon_i} = y_i - \\hat{y_i}$ are the **main ingredient to check model assumptions**. We use plots such as:\n\n1. Histograms or normal probability plots of $\\hat{\\epsilon_i}$\n- useful to check the assumption of normality\n\n2. Plots of $\\hat{\\epsilon_i}$ versus the fitted values $\\hat{y_i}$\n- used to detect changes in error variance\n- used to check if the mean of the errors is zero\n\n3. Plots of $\\hat{\\epsilon_i}$ vs. an explanatory variable $x_{ij}$\n- this helps to check that the variable $x_j$ has a linear relationship with the response variable\n\n4. Plots of $\\hat{\\epsilon_i}$ vs. an explanatory variable $x_{kj}$ that is **not** in the model\n- this helps to check whether the additional variable $x_k$ might have a relationship with the response variable\n\n4. Plots of $\\hat{\\epsilon_i}$ in the order of the observations were collected\n- this is useful to check whether errors might be correlated over time\n\nLet's fit a simple model to predict `BMI` given `waist` for the diabetes study and see if the model meets the assumptions of linear models.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .fig-cap-location-margin}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\n# fit simple linear regression model\nmodel <- lm(BMI ~ waist, data = data_diabetes)\n\n# plot diagnostic plots of the linear model\n# by default plot(model) calls four diagnostics plots\n# par() divides plot window in 2 x 2 grid\npar(mfrow=c(2,2))\nplot(model)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Default diagnostic residual plots based on the lm() model used to assess whether the assumptions of linear models are met.

The blue line gives the linear regression fit to the data, which clearly is not adequate. In comparison, if we used a non-parametric fit, we will get the red line as the fitted relationship.
