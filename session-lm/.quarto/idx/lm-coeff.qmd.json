They have collected data on number of plant species (Species) and number of endemic species on 30 islands as well as some descriptors of the islands such as area [$\\mathrm{km^2}$], elevation [m], distance to nearest island [km], distance to Santa Cruz [km] and the area of the adjacent island [$\\mathrm{km^2}$].  \n\nThe preview of data is here: \n```{r}\n#| label: tbl-gi\n#| tbl-cap: Preview of the Galapagos Islands data\n#| tbl-cap-location: margin\n#| collapse: true\n#| code-fold: true\n\n# data is available via faraway package\nif(!require(faraway)){\n    install.packages(\"faraway\")\n    library(faraway)\n}\n\nhead(gala, 10) %>%\n  kable() %>%\n  kable_paper(\"hover\")\n\n```\n\nAnd we can fit a linear regression model to model number of *Species* given the remaining variables. Let's keep aside for now that number of *Species* is actually a count variable, not a continuous numerical variable, we just want to estimate the number of *Species* for now. \n\n**Fitted Model**\n\n- $Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 Area_i + \\beta_2 Elevation_i + \\beta_3 Nearest_i + \\beta_4 Scruz_i + \\beta_5 Adjacent_i + \\epsilon_i$\n\n```{r}\n#| collapse: true\n#| code-fold: false\n\n# fit multiple linear regression and print model summary\nmodel1 <- lm(Species ~ Area + Elevation + Nearest + Scruz + Adjacent, data = gala)\nprint(summary(model1))\n```\n\n\n**Using the model compare two islands in terms of number of species**\n\n- if the second island has an elevation 1 m higher than the first one?$^1$\n- if the second island has an elevation 100 m higher than the first one?$^2$\n- if the second island is 100 km closer to Santa Cruz?$^3$\n- overall, is there a relationship between the response $Y$ (Species) and predictors?$^4$\n\n<br />  \n\n- $^1$ the second island will have 0.32 species more than the first one, $\\hat{\\beta_2} = 0.319465 \\approx 0.32$\n- $^2$ the second island will have $0.32 \\cdot 100 = 32$ more species than the first one\n- $^3$ the second island would have $-0.24 \\cdot 100 = -24$ less species than the first if there was enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis of $\\beta_4 = 0$; It is not appropriate to try to interpret non-significant coefficients.\n- $^4$ we have seen before that in the case of simple linear regression it was enough to test the null hypothesis of $H_0: \\beta=0$ versus $H_0: \\beta\\neq0$ to answers the question whether there is an overall relationship between response and predictor. In case of multiple regression, with many predictors, we need to test the null hypothesis of $$H_0: \\beta_1 = \\beta_2 = \\dots = \\beta_p = 0$$ versus the alternative $$H_a: at \\; least \\; one \\; \\beta_j \\; is \\; non-zero$$ This hypothesis test is performed by computing **F-statistics** reported in the model summary and calculated as $F = \\frac{(TSS - RSS)/p}{RSS/(n-p-1)}$ where $TSS = \\sum(y_i - \\bar{y})^2$ and $RSS = \\sum(y_i - \\hat{y_i})^2$. Here, the $F-statsitics = 15.7$ and the associated $p-value < 0.05$ so there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative and conclude that there is an overall significant relationship between response (Species) and predictors. \n\n<br />\n**Not so easy: alternative model**\n\n\nConsider an alternative model where we only use elevation to model the number of species\n$$Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 Elevation_i + \\epsilon_i$$\nWe fit the model in `R` and look at the model summary\n```{r}\n#| collapse: true\n#| code-fold: false\nmodel2 <- lm(Species ~ Elevation, data = gala)\nprint(summary(model2))\n```\n\n\n**Using the alternative model compare again two islands in terms of number of species**\n\n- if the second island has an elevation 1 m higher than the first one?$^1$\n- if the second island has an elevation 100 m higher than the first one?$^2$\n\n<br />\n\n- $^1$ the second island will have 0.20 species more than the first one\n- $^2$ the second island will have $0.20 \\cdot 100 = 20$ more species\n\n**Specific interpretation**\n\n- Obviously there is difference between 32 and 20 times more species given the same elevation difference as obtained by the multiple regression (first model) and simple regression (alternative model). \n- Our interpretations need to be more specific and we say that **a unit increase in $x$ with other predictors held constant will produce a change equal to $\\hat{\\beta}$ in the response $y$**\n- It is of course often quite unrealistic to be able to control other variables and keep them constant and for our alternative model, a change in evaluation is most likely associated with other variables, even though they are not included in the model.\n- Further, our explanation contains **no notation of causation**, even though the two models are showing a strong association between elevation and number of species.\n- We will learn later how to choose the best model by assessing its fit and including only relevant variable (feature selection), for now we focus on learning how to interpret the coefficients given a fitted model.\n\n\n\n## Example: Height and gender\n\nData are available containing the weight [lbs] and height [inches] of 10000 men and women\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-height-gender\n#| fig-cap: Box plot for 10 000 heigth measurments stratifed by gender\n#| fig-cap-location: margin\n#| collapse: true\n#| code-fold: false\n\n# read in data\nhtwtgen <- read.csv(\"data/lm/heights_weights_genders.csv\")\nhead(htwtgen)\n\n# boxplot for females and males\nboxplot(htwtgen$Height ~ htwtgen$Gender, \n        xlab=\"\", ylab=\"Height\", col=\"lightblue\")\n```\n\n- We want to **compare the average height of men and women**.\n- We can do that using linear regression and including gender as **binary variable**\n\n**Model**\n\n$$Y_i = \\alpha + \\beta I_{x_i} + \\epsilon_i$$\nwhere\n\\begin{equation}\n    I_{x_i} =\n    \\left\\{\n        \\begin{array}{cc}\n                1 & \\mathrm{if\\ } x_i=1 \\\\\n                0 & \\mathrm{if\\ } x_i=0 \\\\\n        \\end{array}\n    \\right.\n\\end{equation}\nfor some coding, e.g. we choose to set \"Female=1\" and \"Male=0\" or vice versa.\n\nIn `R` we write:\n```{r}\n#| code-fold: false\n#| collapse: true\n\n# Note: check that Gender is indeed non-numeric\nprint(class(htwtgen$Gender))\n\n# fit linear regression and print model summary\nmodel1 <- lm(Height ~ Gender, data = htwtgen)\nprint(summary(model1))\n\n```\n\n**Estimates**\n$$\\hat{\\alpha} = 63.71$$\n$$\\hat{\\beta} = 5.32$$\n\n- the `lm()` function chooses automatically one of the category as baseline, here Females\n- model summary prints the output of the model with the baseline category \"hidden\"\n- i.e. notice the only label we have is \"GenderMale\"\n- meaning that we ended-up having a model coded as below:\n\\begin{equation}\n    I_{x_i} =\n    \\left\\{\n        \\begin{array}{cc}\n                1 & \\mathrm{if\\ } \\quad person_i\\;is\\;male \\\\\n                0 & \\mathrm{if\\ } \\quad person_i\\;is\\;female \\\\\n        \\end{array}\n    \\right.\n\\end{equation}\n- Consequently, if observation $i$ is male then the expected value of height is:\n$$E(Height_i|Male) = 63.71 + 5.32 = 69.03$$\n- and if observation $i$ is female then the expected value of height is:\n$$E(Height_i|Male) = 63.71$$\n\n\n## Example: Height, weight and gender I\n- So as expected, there is a difference in average height between men and women.\n- Can we also observe a significant relationship between weight and height?\n- And if so, does this relationship depend on gender?\n\n```{r}\n#|label: fig-htwtgen-plot\n#|fig-cap: Scatter plot showing height measurments given weight, stratified by gender\n#|fig-cap-location: margin\n#|collapse: true\n#|code-fold: false\n#|fig-width: 5\n#|fig-heigth:

that height increases with weight.\n- On average, men are taller than women.\n- On average, men weight more than women.\n- The relationship between height and weight appears to be the same for males and females, i.e. height increases with weight for both men and women.\n\nTo assess the relationship we use a model containing height and gender.\n\n**Model**\n\n$$Y_i = \\alpha + \\beta I_{x_i} + \\gamma x_{2,i} + \\epsilon_i$$\nwhere\n\\begin{equation}\n    I_{x_i} =\n    \\left\\{\n        \\begin{array}{cc}\n                1 & \\mathrm{if\\ } \\quad person_i\\;is\\;male \\\\\n                0 & \\mathrm{if\\ } \\quad person_i\\;is\\;female \\\\\n        \\end{array}\n    \\right.\n\\end{equation}\n\nand $x_{2,i}$ is the weight of person $i$\n\nIn `R` we write:\n```{r}\n#| code-fold: false\n#| collapse: true\n# fit linear model and print model summary\nmodel2 <- lm(Height ~ Gender + Weight, data = htwtgen)\nprint(summary(model2))\n\n```\n\n**Model together with estimates**\n\n$$Y_i = \\alpha + \\beta I_{x_i} + \\gamma x_{2,i} + \\epsilon_i$$\nwhere\n\\begin{equation}\n    I_{x_i} =\n    \\left\\{\n        \\begin{array}{cc}\n                1 & \\mathrm{if\\

$i$\n\n\n**Estimates**\n\n$$\\hat{\\alpha} = 47.031$$\n$$\\hat{\\beta} = -0.963$$\n$$\\hat{\\gamma} = 0.123$$\n\n\n- Using our estimates, for a male of with an example weight of 161.4 we would predict a height of:\n$$E(Height_i|Male, Weight = 161.4) = 47.031 - 0.963 + (0.123 \\cdot 161.4) = 65.9$$\n- and for a female of weight 161.4 we would predict a height of\n$$E(Height_i|Female, Weight = 161.4) = 47.031 + (0.123 \\cdot 161.4) = 66.9$$\n\nIn `R` we can plot our data and the fitted moded to verify our calculations:\n```{r}\n#| collapse: true\n#| message: false\n#| fig-width: 8\n#| fig-height:
