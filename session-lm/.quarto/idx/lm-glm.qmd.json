We calculate Wald statistics as $W^2 = \\frac{(\\hat\\beta-0)}{\\hat {e.s.e}(\\hat\\beta)} = \\frac{17.174}{2.974} = 5.774714$ and we can find the corresponding p-value using standard normal distribution:\n\n```{r}\n#| code-fold: false\n#| collapse: true\n2*pnorm(5.774714, lower.tail = F)\n```\n\nwhich confirms the summary output shown previously above and shows that there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis at 5% significance level $p-value << 0.05$ and conclude that there is a significant association between `waist` and `obesity status`.\n\n### Deviance {-}\n\n- Deviance is the number that measures the goodness of fit of a logistic regression model.\n- We use saturated and residual deviance to assess model, instead of $R^2$ or $R^2(adj)$.\n- We can also use deviance to check the association between explanatory variable and the outcome, an alternative and slightly more powerful test than Wald test (although these two test give similar results when sample size is large).\n- In the **likelihood ratio test** the test statistics is the **deviance** for the full model minus the deviance for the full model excluding the relevant explanatory variable. This test statistics follow a Chi-squared distribution with 1 degree of freedom.\n\n<br>\n\nFor instance, given our model we have null deviance of 274.4 and residual deviance of 268.7. The difference 5.7 is larger than than 95th percentile of $\\chi^2(129-128)$ = 3.841459, where 129 is degrees of freedom for null model and 128 is degrees of freedom for null model excluding the `waist` explanatory variable. \n```{r}\n#| code-fold: false\n#| collapse: true\nqchisq(df=1, p=0.95)\n```\n- Again $5.7 > 3.84$ and we can conclude that `waist` is a significant term in the model.\n\n### Odds ratios {-}\n\n- In logistic regression we often interpret the model coefficients by taking $e^{\\hat{\\beta}}$\n- and we talk about **odd ratios**.\n- For instance we can say, given our above model, $e^{17.174} = 28745736$ that for each unit increase in `waist` the odds of suffering from obesity get multiplied by 28745736. \n\n\nThese odds ratios are very high as here we are modeling obesity status with waist measurements, and increasing one unit in waist would mean adding up additional 1m to waist measurements. Typically:\n\n- Odd ratios of 1.0 (or close to 1.0) indicates that exposure is not associated with the outcome.\n- Odds ratios $> 1.0$ indicates that the odds of exposure among cases are greater than the odds of\nexposure among controls. \n- Odds raitos $< 1.0$ indicates that the odds of exposure among cases are lower than the odds of\nexposure among controls. \n- The magnitude of the odds ratio is called the **strength of the association**. The further away an odds ratio is from 1.0, the more likely it is that the relationship between the exposure and the disease is causal. For example, an odds ratio of 1.2 is above 1.0, but is not a strong association. An odds ratio of 10 suggests a stronger association.\n\n### Other covariates {-}\n\n- We can use the same logic as in multiple regression to expand by models by additional variables, numerical, binary or categorical. \n- For instance, we can test whether there is a gender effect when suffering from obesity:\n\n```{r}\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\n#| code-fold: false\n#| collapse: true\n#| fig-cap: \"Obesity status model with logistic regression given waist and gender exploratory variables.

1.05$.\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":"html_document","warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"lm-glm.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
