We use plots such as:\n\n1. Histograms or normal probability plots of $\\hat{\\epsilon_i}$\n- useful to check the assumption of normality\n\n2. Plots of $\\hat{\\epsilon_i}$ versus the fitted values $\\hat{y_i}$\n- used to detect changes in error variance\n- used to check if the mean of the errors is zero\n\n3. Plots of $\\hat{\\epsilon_i}$ vs. an explanatory variable $x_{ij}$\n- this helps to check that the variable $x_j$ has a linear relationship with the response variable\n\n4. Plots of $\\hat{\\epsilon_i}$ vs. an explanatory variable $x_{kj}$ that is **not** in the model\n- this helps to check whether the additional variable $x_k$ might have a relationship with the response variable\n\n4. Plots of $\\hat{\\epsilon_i}$ in the order of the observations were collected\n- this is useful to check whether errors might be correlated over time\n\nLet's fit a simple model to predict `BMI` given `waist` for the diabetes study and see if the model meets the assumptions of linear models.\n\n\n```{r}\n#| code-fold: false\n#| collapse: true\n#| fig-cap: \"Default diagnostic residual plots based on the lm() model used to assess whether the assumptions of linear models are met.
