\\hat{y_i}$ are the **main ingredient to check model assumptions**. We use plots such as:\n\n1. Histograms or normal probability plots of $\\hat{\\epsilon_i}$\n- useful to check the assumption of normality\n\n2. Plots of $\\hat{\\epsilon_i}$ versus the fitted values $\\hat{y_i}$\n- used to detect changes in error variance\n- used to check if the mean of the errors is zero\n\n3. Plots of $\\hat{\\epsilon_i}$ vs. an explanatory variable $x_{ij}$\n- this helps to check that the variable $x_j$ has a linear relationship with the response variable\n\n4. Plots of $\\hat{\\epsilon_i}$ vs. an explanatory variable $x_{kj}$ that is **not** in the model\n- this helps to check whether the additional variable $x_k$ might have a relationship with the response variable\n\n4. Plots of $\\hat{\\epsilon_i}$ in the order of the observations were collected\n- this is useful to check whether errors might be correlated over time\n\nLet's look at the \"good\" example going back to our data of protein levels during pregnancy\n\n```{r}\n#| collapse: true\n#| fig-align: center\n#| fig-width: 10\n#| fig-height: 10\n\n# read in data\ndata.protein <- read.csv(\"data/lm/protein.csv\")\n\nprotein <- data.protein$Protein # our Y\ngestation <- data.protein$Gestation # our X\n\nmodel <- lm(protein ~ gestation)\n\n# plot diagnostic plots of the linear model\n# by default plot(model) calls four diagnostics plots\n# par() divides plot window in 2 x 2 grid\npar(mfrow=c(2,2))\nplot(model)\n\n```\n\n- the residual plots provides examples of a situation where the assumptions appear to be met\n- the linear regression appears to describe data quite well\n- there is no obvious trend of any kind in the residuals vs. fitted values (the shape is scattered)\n- points lie reasonably well along the line in the normal probability plot, hence normality appears to be met\n\n**Examples of assumptions not being met**\n\n\n```{r}\n#| fig-cap: Example of data with a typical seasonal variation (up and down) coupled wtih a linear trend. The blue line gives the linear regression fit to the data, which clearly is not adequate. In comparison, if we used a non-parametric fit, we will get the red line as the fitted relationship.

We also know how to assess model fit, check model assumptions and find potential outliers. Given a set of predictors, e.g. many genes, how do we arrive at the best model?\n- As a rule of thumb, we want a model that **fits the data best and is as simple as possible**, meaning it contains only relevant predictors.\n- In practice, this means, that for smaller data sets, e.g. with up to 10 predictors, one works with **manually** trying different models, including different subsets of predictors, interactions terms and/or their transformations. \n- When the number of predictors is large, one can try **automated approaches of feature selection** like forward selection or stepwise regression, the last one demonstrated in the exercises below. \n- Finally, as we will learn later in the course, we can use **regularization techniques** that allow including all parameters in the model but constrain (regularizes) coefficient estimates towards zero for the less relevant predictors, preventing building complex models and thus overfitting. \n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":"html_document","warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"lm-diagn.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.36","bibliography":["references.bib"],"theme":"cosmo","editor_options":{"chunk_output_type":"console"}},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":"html_document","warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"lm-diagn.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"documentclass":"scrreprt","editor_options":{"chunk_output_type":"console"}},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
