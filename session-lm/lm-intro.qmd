## Why linear models? 

With linear models we can answer questions such as: 

  - is there a relationship between exposure and outcome, e.g. height and weight?
  - how strong is the relationship between the two variables?
  - what will be a predicted value of the outcome given a new set of exposure values?
  - how accurately can we predict outcome?
  - which variables are associated with the response, e.g. is it only height that explains weight or could it be height and age that are both associated with the response?

## Statistical vs. deterministic relationship

Relationships in probability and statistics can generally be one of three things: deterministic, random, or statistical:

- a **deterministic** relationship involves **an exact relationship** between two variables, for instance Fahrenheit and Celsius degrees is defined by an equation $Fahrenheit=\frac{9}{5}\cdot Celcius+32$
- there is **no relationship** between variables in the **random relationship**, for instance number of succulents Olga buys and time of the year as Olga keeps buying succulents whenever she feels like it throughout the entire year
- **a statistical relationship** is a **mixture of deterministic and random relationship**, e.g. the savings that Olga has left in the bank account depend on Olga's monthly salary income (deterministic part) and the money spent on buying succulents (random part)


```{r}
#| label: fig-relationship
#| fig-cap: "Deterministic vs. statistical relationship: a) deterministic: equation exactly describes the relationship between the two variables e.g. Ferenheit and Celcius relationship, b) statistical relationship between $x$ and $y$ is not perfect (increasing relationship), c)  statistical relationship between $x$ and $y$ is not perfect (decreasing relationship), d) random signal"

## What linear models are and are not

- In an linear model we model (explain) the relationship between a single continuous variable $Y$ and one or more variables $X$. The $X$ variables can be numerical, categorical or a mixture of both.
- One very general form for the model would be: 
$$Y = f(X_1, X_2, \dots X_p) + \epsilon$$ where $f$ is some unknown function and $\epsilon$ is the error in this representation.

- For instance a **simple linear regression** through the origin is a simple linear model of the form $$Y_i = \beta \cdot x + \epsilon$$ often used to express a relationship of **one numerical variable to another**, e.g. the calories burnt and the kilometers cycled.
- Linear models can become quite advanced by including **many variables**, e.g. the calories burnt could be a function of the kilometers cycled, road incline and status of a bike, or the **transformation of the variables**, e.g. a function of kilometers cycled squared
- Formally, a linear model is one in which the **parameters appear linearly in the deterministic part of the model**. 


For instance these are all linear models in where parameters enter linearly:

```{r}
#| label: fig-linear-adv
#| fig-cap: "Examples of a linear modesl: A) $y_i = x_1 + e_i$, B) $x_1 + I_{x_i} + e_i$ C) $y_i = x_i^2 + e_i$, D) $y_i = x + x_i^3 + e_i$ showing that linear models can get more complex and/or capture more than a straight line relationship."

- $Y_i = \alpha + x_i^\beta +  \epsilon$


## Terminology
There are many terms and notations used interchangeably:

- $y$ is being called:
  - response
  - outcome
  - dependent variable

- $x$ is being called:
  - exposure
  - explanatory variable
  - dependent variable
  - predictor
  - covariate



## Simple linear regression
- It is used to check the association between **the numerical outcome and one numerical explanatory variable**
- In practice, we are finding the best-fitting straight line to describe the relationship between the outcome and exposure


:::{#exm-simple-lm}
## Weight and plasma volume

Let's look at the example data containing body weight (kg) and plasma volume (liters) for eight healthy men to see what the best-fitting straight line is.

Example data:
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
weight <- c(58, 70, 74, 63.5, 62.0, 70.5, 71.0, 66.0) # body weight (kg)
plasma <- c(2.75, 2.86, 3.37, 2.76, 2.62, 3.49, 3.05, 3.12) # plasma volume (liters)

```
:::

```{r}
#| label: fig-lm-intro-example
#| fig-cap: "Scatter plot of the data shows that high plasma volume tends to be associated with high weight and *vice verca*."
#| fig-cap-location: margin

#| fig-width: 4
#| fig-heigth: 4

plot(weight, plasma, pch=19, las=1, xlab = "body weight [kg]", ylab="plasma volume [l]",  panel.first = grid())

```

```{r}
#| label: fig-lm-example-reg
#| fig-cap: "Scatter plot of the data shows that high plasma volume tends to be associated with high weight and *vice verca*. Linear regression gives the equation of the straight line (red) that best describes how the outcome changes (increase or decreases) with a change of exposure variable"

#| echo: false
#| fig-width: 4
#| fig-heigth: 4

plot(weight, plasma, pch=19, las=1, xlab = "body weight [kg]", ylab="plasma volume [l]", panel.first = grid())

reg1 <- lm(plasma ~ weight)
a <- reg1$coefficients[1]
b <- reg1$coefficients[2]

abline(a=a+0.1 , b + 0.001, col="gray")
abline(a=a+0.1 , b + 0.0001, col="gray")
#abline(a=a , b + 0.00015, col="gray")
abline(a=a+0.1 , b + 0.002, col="gray")
abline(a=a+0.1 , b - 0.002, col="gray")
abline(a=a+0.1 , b - 0.002, col="gray")
abline(a=a+0.1 , b - 0.001, col="gray")
abline(a=a, b - 0.001, col="gray")
abline(a=a+0.5 , b , col="gray")
abline(a=a-0.5 , b , col="gray")

abline(lm(plasma~weight), col="red") # regression line
points(weight, plasma, pch=19)


```

The equation for the red line is:
$$Y_i=0.086 +  0.044 \cdot x_i \quad for \;i = 1 \dots 8$$
and in general:
$$Y_i=\alpha + \beta \cdot x_i \quad for \; i = 1 \dots n$$

- In other words, by finding the best-fitting straight line we are **building a statistical model** to represent the relationship between plasma volume ($Y$) and explanatory body weight variable ($x$)
- If we were to use our model $Y_i=0.086 + 0.044 \cdot x_i$ to find plasma volume given a weight of 58 kg (our first observation, $i=1$), we would notice that we would get $Y=0.086 +  0.044 \cdot 58 = 2.638$, not exactly $2.75$ as we have for our first man in our dataset that we started with, i.e. $2.75 - 2.638 = 0.112 \neq 0$.
- We thus add to the above equation an **error term** to account for this and now we can write our **simple regression model** more formally as:

$$Y_i = \alpha + \beta \cdot x_i + \epsilon_i$$ {#eq-lm}
where:

- $x$: is called: exposure variable, explanatory variable, dependent variable, predictor, covariate
- $y$: is called: response, outcome, dependent variable
- $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are **model coefficients**
- and $\epsilon_i$ is an **error terms**


## Least squares
- in the above **"body weight - plasma volume"** example, the values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ have just appeared
- in practice, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ values are unknown and we use data to **estimate these coefficients**, noting the estimates with a **hat**, $\hat{\alpha}$ and $\hat{\beta}$
- **least squares** is one of the methods of parameters estimation, i.e. finding $\hat{\alpha}$ and $\hat{\beta}$

Let $\hat{y_i}=\hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta}x_i$ be the prediction $y_i$ based on the $i$-th value of $x$:

- Then $\epsilon_i = y_i - \hat{y_i}$ represents the $i$-th **residual**, i.e. the difference between the $i$-th observed response value and the $i$-th response value that is predicted by the linear model
- RSS, the **residual sum of squares** is defined as: $$RSS = \epsilon_1^2 + \epsilon_2^2 + \dots + \epsilon_n^2$$ or
equivalently as: $$RSS=(y_1-\hat{\alpha}-\hat{\beta}x_1)^2+(y_2-\hat{\alpha}-\hat{\beta}x_2)^2+...+(y_n-\hat{\alpha}-\hat{\beta}x_n)^2$$
- the least squares approach chooses $\hat{\alpha}$ and $\hat{\beta}$ **to minimize the RSS**. With some calculus, a good video explanation for the interested ones is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewnc1cXJmGA), we get @thm-lss

## Least squares estimates for a simple linear regression

$$\hat{\beta} = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}}$$
$$\hat{\alpha} = \bar{y}-\frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}}\cdot \bar{x}$$

where:

- $\bar{x}$: mean value of $x$
- $\bar{y}$: mean value of $y$
- $S_{xx}$: sum of squares of $X$ defined as $S_{xx} = \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\bar{x})^2$
- $S_{yy}$: sum of squares of $Y$ defined as  $S_{yy} = \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-\bar{y})^2$
- $S_{xy}$: sum of products of $X$ and $Y$ defined as $S_{xy} = \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})$

:::


<!-- We can further re-write the above sum of squares to obtain -->

<!-- - sum of squares of $X$, $$S_{xx} = \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\bar{x})^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2-\frac{(\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i)^2}{n})$$ -->

## Least squares

Let's try least squares method to find coefficient estimates in the **"body weight and plasma volume example"**

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

# initial data
weight <- c(58, 70, 74, 63.5, 62.0, 70.5, 71.0, 66.0) # body weight (kg)
plasma <- c(2.75, 2.86, 3.37, 2.76, 2.62, 3.49, 3.05, 3.12) # plasma volume (liters)

# rename variables for convenience
x <- weight
y <- plasma

# mean values of x and y
x.bar <- mean(x)
y.bar <- mean(y)

# Sum of squares
Sxx <-  sum((x - x.bar)^2)
Sxy <- sum((x-x.bar)*(y-y.bar))

# Coefficient estimates
beta.hat <- Sxy / Sxx
alpha.hat <- y.bar - Sxy/Sxx*x.bar

# Print estimated coefficients alpha and beta
print(alpha.hat)
print(beta.hat)

```

:::


In R we can use `lm()`, the built-in function, to fit a linear regression model and we can replace the above code with one line

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
lm(plasma ~ weight)
```

## Intercept and Slope
- Linear regression gives us estimates of model coefficient $Y_i = \alpha + \beta x_i + \epsilon_i$
- $\alpha$ is known as the **intercept**
- $\beta$ is known as the **slope**

## Hypothesis testing

**Is there a relationship between the response and the predictor?**

- the calculated $\hat{\alpha}$ and $\hat{\beta}$ are **estimates of the population values** of the intercept and slope and are therefore subject to **sampling variation**
- their precision is measured by their **estimated standard errors**, `e.s.e`($\hat{\alpha}$) and `e.s.e`($\hat{\beta}$)
- these estimated standard errors are used in **hypothesis testing** and in constructing **confidence and prediction intervals**

**The most common hypothesis test** involves testing the ``null hypothesis`` of:

- $H_0:$ There is no relationship between $X$ and $Y$
- versus the ``alternative hypothesis`` $H_a:$ there is some relationship between $X$ and $Y$

**Mathematically**, this corresponds to testing:

- $H_0: \beta=0$
- versus $H_a: \beta\neq0$
- since if $\beta=0$ then the model $Y_i=\alpha+\beta x_i + \epsilon_i$ reduces to $Y=\alpha + \epsilon_i$

**Under the null hypothesis** $H_0: \beta = 0$
<!-- we have: $$\frac{\hat{\beta}-\beta}{e.s.e(\hat{\beta})} \sim t(n-p)$$  -->
![](figures/linear-models/lm-tstatistics.png)

- $n$ is number of observations
- $p$ is number of model parameters
- $\frac{\hat{\beta}-\beta}{e.s.e(\hat{\beta})}$ is the ratio of the departure of the estimated value of a parameter, $\hat\beta$, from its hypothesized value, $\beta$, to its standard error, called `t-statistics`
- the `t-statistics` follows Student's t distribution with $n-p$ degrees of freedom

::: {#exm-hypothesis-testing}

## Hypothesis testing

Let's look again at our example data. This time we will not only fit the linear regression model but also look a bit more closely at the `R summary` of the model

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

weight <- c(58, 70, 74, 63.5, 62.0, 70.5, 71.0, 66.0) # body weight (kg)
plasma <- c(2.75, 2.86, 3.37, 2.76, 2.62, 3.49, 3.05, 3.12) # plasma volume (liters)

model <- lm(plasma ~ weight)
print(summary(model))

```

:::

- Under `Estimate` we see estimates of our model coefficients, $\hat{\alpha}$ (intercept) and $\hat{\beta}$ (slope, here weight), followed by their estimated standard errors, `Std. Errors`
- If we were to test if there is an **association between weight and plasma volume** we would write under the null hypothesis $H_0: \beta = 0$ $$\frac{\hat{\beta}-\beta}{e.s.e(\hat{\beta})} = \frac{0.04362-0}{0.01527} = 2.856582$$
- and we would **compare** `t-statistics` to `Student's t distribution` with $n-p = 8 - 2 = 6$ degrees of freedom (as we have 8 observations and two model parameters, $\alpha$ and $\beta$)
- we can use **Student's t distribution table** or **R code** to obtain the associated *P*-value

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
2*pt(2.856582, df=6, lower=F)

- here the observed t-statistics is large and therefore yields a small *P*-value, meaning that **there is sufficient evidence to reject null hypothesis in favor of the alternative** and conclude that there is a significant association between weight and plasma volume


## Vector-matrix notations

While in simple linear regression it is feasible to arrive at the parameters estimates using calculus in more realistic settings of **multiple regression**, with more than one explanatory variable in the model, it is **more efficient to use vectors and matrices to define the regression model**.

Let's **rewrite** our simple linear regression model $Y_i = \alpha + \beta_i + \epsilon_i \quad i=1,\dots n$ **into vector-matrix notation** in **6 steps**.

1. First we rename our $\alpha$ to $\beta_0$ and $\beta$ to $\beta_1$ as it is easier to keep tracking the number of model parameters this way

2. Then we notice that we actually have $n$ equations such as:
$$y_1 = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \epsilon_1$$
$$y_2 = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_2 + \epsilon_2$$
$$y_3 = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_3 + \epsilon_3$$
$$\dots$$
$$y_n = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_n + \epsilon_n$$

3. We group all $Y_i$ and $\epsilon_i$ into column vectors:
$\mathbf{Y}=\begin{bmatrix}
  y_1  \\
  y_2    \\
  \vdots \\
  y_{n}
\end{bmatrix}$ and
$\boldsymbol\epsilon=\begin{bmatrix}
  \epsilon_1  \\
  \epsilon_2    \\
  \vdots \\
  \epsilon_{n}
\end{bmatrix}$

4. We stack two parameters $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ into another column vector:$$\boldsymbol\beta=\begin{bmatrix}
  \beta_0  \\
  \beta_1
\end{bmatrix}$$

5. We append a vector of ones with the single predictor for each $i$ and create a matrix with two columns called **design matrix** $$\mathbf{X}=\begin{bmatrix}
  1 & x_1  \\
  1 & x_2  \\
  \vdots & \vdots \\
  1 & x_{n}
\end{bmatrix}$$

6. We write our linear model in a vector-matrix notations as:
$$\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol\beta + \boldsymbol\epsilon$$

## vector matrix form of the linear model

The vector-matrix representation of a linear model with $p-1$ predictors can be written as
$$\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol\beta + \boldsymbol\epsilon$$

where:

- $\mathbf{Y}$ is $n \times1$ vector of observations
- $\mathbf{X}$ is $n \times p$ **design matrix**
- $\boldsymbol\beta$ is $p \times1$ vector of parameters
- $\boldsymbol\epsilon$ is $n \times1$ vector of vector of random errors, indepedent and identically distributed (i.i.d) N(0, $\sigma^2$)

In full, the above vectors and matrix have the form:

$\mathbf{Y}=\begin{bmatrix}
  y_1  \\
  y_2    \\
  \vdots \\
  y_{n}
\end{bmatrix}$
$\boldsymbol\beta=\begin{bmatrix}
  \beta_0  \\
  \beta_1    \\
  \vdots \\
  \beta_{p}
\end{bmatrix}$
$\boldsymbol\epsilon=\begin{bmatrix}
  \epsilon_1  \\
  \epsilon_2    \\
  \vdots \\
  \epsilon_{n}
\end{bmatrix}$
$\mathbf{X}=\begin{bmatrix}
  1 & x_{1,1} & \dots & x_{1,p-1} \\
  1 & x_{2,1} & \dots & x_{2,p-1} \\
  \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
  1 & x_{n,1} & \dots & x_{n,p-1}
\end{bmatrix}$

## Least squares in vector-matrix notation

The least squares estimates for a linear regression of the form:
$$\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol\beta + \boldsymbol\epsilon$$

is given by:
$$\hat{\mathbf{\beta}}= (\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{Y}$$

:::


::: {#exm-vector-matrix-notation}

## vector-matrix-notation

Following the above definition we can write the **"weight - plasma volume model"** as:
$$\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol\beta + \boldsymbol\epsilon$$
where:

$\mathbf{Y}=\begin{bmatrix}
 2.75  \\ 2.86 \\ 3.37 \\ 2.76 \\ 2.62 \\ 3.49 \\ 3.05 \\ 3.12
\end{bmatrix}$

$\boldsymbol\beta=\begin{bmatrix}
  \beta_0  \\
  \beta_1
\end{bmatrix}$
$\boldsymbol\epsilon=\begin{bmatrix}
  \epsilon_1  \\
  \epsilon_2    \\
  \vdots \\
  \epsilon_{8}
\end{bmatrix}$
$\mathbf{X}=\begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 58.0 \\
  1 & 70.0 \\
  1 & 74.0 \\
  1 & 63.5 \\
  1 & 62.0 \\
  1 & 70.5 \\
  1 & 71.0 \\
  1 & 66.0 \\
\end{bmatrix}$

and we can estimate model parameters using $\hat{\mathbf{\beta}}= (\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{Y}$.

We can do it by hand or in `R` as follows:

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

n <- length(plasma) # no. of observation
Y <- as.matrix(plasma, ncol=1)
X <- cbind(rep(1, length=n), weight)
X <- as.matrix(X)

# print Y and X to double-check that the format is according to the definition
print(Y)
print(X)

# least squares estimate
# solve() finds inverse of matrix
beta.hat <- solve(t(X)%*%X)%*%t(X)%*%Y
print(beta.hat)

```

## Confidence intervals and prediction intervals

- when we estimate coefficients we can also find their **confidence intervals**, typically 95\% confidence intervals, i.e. a range of values that contain the true unknown value of the parameter
- we can also use linear regression models to predict the response value given a new observation and find **prediction intervals**. Here, we look at any specific value of $x_i$, and find an interval around the predicted value $y_i'$ for $x_i$ such that there is a 95\% probability that the real value of y (in the population) corresponding to $x_i$ is within this interval

::: {#exm-prediction-and-intervals}

## Prediction and intervals

Let's:

- find confidence intervals for our coefficient estimates
- predict plasma volume for a men weighting 60 kg
- find prediction interval
- plot original data, fitted regression model, predicted observation and prediction interval

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

# fit regression model
model <- lm(plasma ~ weight)
print(summary(model))

# find confidence intervals for the model coefficients
confint(model)

# predict plasma volume for a new observation of 60 kg
# we have to create data frame with a variable name matching the one used to build the model
new.obs <- data.frame(weight = 60)
predict(model, newdata = new.obs)

# find prediction intervals
prediction.interval <- predict(model, newdata = new.obs,  interval = "prediction")
print(prediction.interval)

# plot the original data, fitted regression and predicted value
plot(weight, plasma, pch=19, xlab="weight [kg]", ylab="plasma [l]", ylim=c(2,4))
lines(weight, model$fitted.values, col="red") # fitted model in red
points(new.obs, predict(model, newdata = new.obs), pch=19, col="blue") # predicted value at 60kg
segments(60, prediction.interval[2], 60, prediction.interval[3], lty = 3) # add prediction interval

```

## Assessing model fit

- Earlier we learned how to estimate parameters in a liner model using least squares estimation.
- Now we will consider how to assess the goodness of fit of a model, i.e. how well does the model explain our data. 
- We do that by calculating the amount of variability in the response that is explained by the model.

### $R^2$: summary of the fitted model {-}
- considering a simple linear regression, the simplest model, **Model 0**, we could consider fitting is $$Y_i = \beta_0+ \epsilon_i$$ that corresponds to a line that run through the data but lies parallel to the horizontal axis
- in our plasma volume example that would correspond the mean value of plasma volume being predicted for any value of weight (in purple)

```{r}
#| collapse: true
#| echo: false
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-height: 5
#| fig-align: center

weight <- c(58, 70, 74, 63.5, 62.0, 70.5, 71.0, 66.0) # body weight (kg)
plasma <- c(2.75, 2.86, 3.37, 2.76, 2.62, 3.49, 3.05, 3.12) # plasma volume (liters)

plot(weight, plasma, pch=19, xlab="Weight [kg]", ylab="Plasma volume [l]")
abline(h=mean(plasma), col="purple")

```

- TSS, denoted **Total corrected sum-of-squares** is the residual sum-of-squares for Model 0
$$S(\hat{\beta_0}) = TSS = \sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \bar{y})^2 = S_{yy}$$ corresponding the to the sum of squared distances to the purple line

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-height: 5
#| fig-align: center

plot(weight, plasma, pch=19, xlab="Weight [kg]", ylab="Plasma volume [l]")
abline(h=mean(plasma), col="purple")

for (i in 1:length(weight)){
  segments(weight[i], plasma[i], weight[i], mean(plasma))
}

```

- Fitting **Model 1** of the form $$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x + \epsilon_i$$ we have earlier defined
- **RSS**, the residual sum-of-squares as:
$$RSS = \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \{\hat{\beta_0} + \hat{\beta}_1x_{1i} + \dots + \hat{\beta}_px_{pi}\}) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \hat{y_i})^2$$
- that corresponds to the squared distances between the observed values $y_i, \dots,y_n$ to fitted values $\hat{y_1}, \dots \hat{y_n}$, i.e. distances to the red fitted line

```{r, echo=F, fig.align="center", fig.width=5, fig.height=4}
#| echo: false
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-height: 5
#| fig-align: center

plot(weight, plasma, pch=19, xlab="Weight [kg]", ylab="Plasma volume [l]")
abline(lm(plasma ~ weight), col="red")
model <- lm(plasma ~ weight)

for (i in 1:length(weight)){
  segments(weight[i], plasma[i], weight[i], model$fitted.values[i])
}

```

::: {#def-r2}

## $R^2$ {-}

A simple but useful measure of model fit is given by $$R^2 = 1 - \frac{RSS}{TSS}$$ where:

- RSS is the residual sum-of-squares for Model 1, the fitted model of interest
- TSS is the sum of squares of the **null model**

:::

- $R^2$ quantifies how much of a drop in the residual sum-of-squares is accounted for by fitting the proposed model
- $R^2$ is also referred as **coefficient of determination**
- It is expressed on a scale, as a proportion (between 0 and 1) of the total variation in the data
- Values of $R^2$ approaching 1 indicate the model to be a good fit
- Values of $R^2$ less than 0.5 suggest that the model gives rather a poor fit to the data

### $R^2$ and correlation coefficient {-}

::: {#thm-r2}
## $R^2$

In the case of simple linear regression:

Model 1: $Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x + \epsilon_i$
$$R^2 = r^2$$
where:

- $R^2$ is the coefficient of determination
- $r^2$ is the sample correlation coefficient

:::


### $R^2(adj)$ {-}
- in the case of multiple linear regression, where there is more than one explanatory variable in the model
- we are using the adjusted version of $R^2$ to assess the model fit
- as the number of explanatory variables increase, $R^2$ also increases
- $R^2(adj)$ takes this into account, i.e. adjusts for the fact that there is more than one explanatory variable in the model


::: {#thm-r2adj}

## $R^2(adj)$

For any multiple linear regression
$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_{1i} + \dots + \beta_{p-1}x_{(p-1)i} +  \epsilon_i$$ $R^2(adj)$ is defined as
$$R^2(adj) = 1-\frac{\frac{RSS}{n-p-1}}{\frac{TSS}{n-1}}$$ where

- $p$ is the number of independent predictors, i.e. the number of variables in the model, excluding the constant

$R^2(adj)$ can also be calculated from $R^2$:
$$R^2(adj) = 1 - (1-R^2)\frac{n-1}{n-p-1}$$

:::

<!-- We can calculate the values in R and compare the results to the output of linear regression -->

```{r}
#| collapse: true
#| code-fold: false
#| include: false
#| eval: false

htwtgen <- read.csv("data/lm/heights_weights_genders.csv")
head(htwtgen)
attach(htwtgen)

## Simple linear regression
model.simple <- lm(Height ~ Weight, data=htwtgen)

# TSS
TSS <- sum((Height - mean(Height))^2)

# RSS
# residuals are returned in the model type names(model.simple)
RSS <- sum((model.simple$residuals)^2)
R2 <- 1 - (RSS/TSS)

print(R2)
print(summary(model.simple))

## Multiple regression
model.multiple <- lm(Height ~ Weight + Gender, data=htwtgen)
n <- length(Weight)
p <- 1

RSS <- sum((model.multiple$residuals)^2)
R2_adj <- 1 - (RSS/(n-p-1))/(TSS/(n-1))

print(R2_adj)
print(summary(model.multiple))

```

Let's practice in exercises fitting linear models, hypothesis testing and assessing model fit.
