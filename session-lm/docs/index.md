# Preface {-}

Linear models allows us to answer questions such as: 

- is there a relationship between exposure and outcome, e.g. body weight and plasma volume?
- how strong is the relationship between the two variables?
- what will be a predicted value of the outcome given a new set of exposure values?
- how accurately can we predict outcome?
- which variables are associated with the response, e.g. is it body weight and height that can explain the plasma volume or is it just the body weight?
