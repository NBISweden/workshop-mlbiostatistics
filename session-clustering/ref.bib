	abstract = {In recent years, the effect of the curse of high dimensionality has been studied in great detail on several problems such as clustering, nearest neighbor search, and indexing. In high dimensional space the data becomes sparse, and traditional indexing and algorithmic techniques fail from a efficiency and/or effectiveness perspective. Recent research results show that in high dimensional space, the concept of proximity, distance or nearest neighbor may not even be qualitatively meaningful. In this paper, we view the dimensionality curse from the point of view of the distance metrics which are used to measure the similarity between objects. We specifically examine the behavior of the commonly used Lk norm and show that the problem of meaningfulness in high dimensionality is sensitive to the value of k. For example, this means that the Manhattan distance metric (L1 norm) is consistently more preferable than the Euclidean distance metric (L2 norm) for high dimensional data mining applications. Using the intuition derived from our analysis, we introduce and examine a natural extension of the Lk norm to fractional distance metrics. We show that the fractional distance metric provides more meaningful results both from the theoretical and empirical perspective. The results show that fractional distance metrics can significantly improve the effectiveness of standard clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm.},

@article{Traag2019,
	abstract = {Community detection is often used to understand the structure of large and complex networks. One of the most popular algorithms for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case, communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe that up to 25% of the communities are badly connected and up to 16% are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it converges to a partition in which all subsets of all communities are locally optimally assigned. Furthermore, by relying on a fast local move approach, the Leiden algorithm runs faster than the Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the Leiden algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find that the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm and uncovers better partitions, in addition to providing explicit guarantees.},

	abstract = {Summary: Pvclust is an add-on package for a statistical software R to assess the uncertainty in hierarchical cluster analysis. Pvclust can be used easily for general statistical problems, such as DNA microarray analysis, to perform the bootstrap analysis of clustering, which has been popular in phylogenetic analysis. Pvclust calculates probability values (p-values) for each cluster using bootstrap resampling techniques. Two types of p-values are available: approximately unbiased (AU) p-value and bootstrap probability (BP) value. Multiscale bootstrap resampling is used for the calculation of AU p-value, which has superiority in bias over BP value calculated by the ordinary bootstrap resampling. In addition the computation time can be enormously decreased with parallel computing option. {\copyright} 2006 Oxford University Press.},

	abstract = {Cluster analyzes have been widely used in mental health research to decompose inter-individual heterogeneity by identifying more homogeneous subgroups of individuals. However, despite advances in new algorithms and increasing popularity, there is little guidance on model choice, analytical framework and reporting requirements. In this paper, we aimed to address this gap by introducing the philosophy, design, advantages/disadvantages and implementation of major algorithms that are particularly relevant in mental health research. Extensions of basic models, such as kernel methods, deep learning, semi-supervised clustering, and clustering ensembles are subsequently introduced. How to choose algorithms to address common issues as well as methods for pre-clustering data processing, clustering evaluation and validation are then discussed. Importantly, we also provide general guidance on clustering workflow and reporting requirements. To facilitate the implementation of different algorithms, we provide information on R functions and libraries.},

@article{Lloyd1982,
	abstract = {It has long been realized that in pulse-code modulation (PCM), with a given ensemble of signals to handle, the quantum values should be spaced more closely in the voltage regions where the signal amplitude is more likely to fall. It has been shown by Panter and Dite that, in the limit as the number of quanta becomes infinite, the asymptotic fractional density of quanta per unit voltage should vary as the one-third power of the probability density per unit voltage of signal amplitudes. In this paper the corresponding result for any finite number of quanta is derived; that is, necessary conditions are found that the quanta and associated quantization intervals of an optimum finite quantization scheme must satisfy. The optimization criterion used is that the average quantization noise power be a minimum. It is shown that the result obtained here goes over into the Panter and Dite result as the number of quanta become large. The optimum quantization schemes for 2b quanta, b = 1,2, ···, 7, are given numerically for Gaussian and for Laplacian distribution of signal amplitudes. {\copyright}1982 IEEE},

An efficient version of the algorithm is presented here.\nThe aim of the K-means algorithm is to divide M points in N dimensions into K clusters so that the within-cluster sum of squares is minimized. It is not practical to require that the solution has minimal sum of squares against all partitions except when M,N are small and K = 2. We seek instead "local" optima, solution such that no movement of a point from one cluster to another will reduce the within cluster sum of squares.},

@article{Forgy1965,
	abstract = {In recent years a number of procedures to cluster, group, or classify a sample of data points have been advanced, but such methods are still not generally accepted as useful and dependable tools for data analysis. Much of the reluctance to rely on these methods may be due to uncertainty as to just what the end result of a cluster analysis means. This of course depends on the particular method used. In the literature two rather different purposes of clustering methods may be discerned. (1) To establish a maximally efficient way of partitioning the sample into given numbers of classes. The classical measure of efficiency is the pooled variance within classes, which is to be minimized. (2) To discover and describe the 'natural' way of classifying the sample. Here the data determine the number of classes, so there is the possibility of there being no partitioning at all. Examples of methods advanced for each purpose are given, and experimental results of several of these upon samples from known multivariate populations with and without 'natural' partitionings are presented. The most striking finding is that some procedures having the second purpose will almost always suggest 'natural' (i.e. interpretable) classifications when in fact there are none (e.g. in data from a joint normal population). A user would thus be exposed to virtual certainty of Type I error. Improved clustering procedures are suggested for both purposes.},

@article{Preud2021,
	abstract = {The choice of the most appropriate unsupervised machine-learning method for ``heterogeneous'' or ``mixed'' data, i.e. with both continuous and categorical variables, can be challenging. Our aim was to examine the performance of various clustering strategies for mixed data using both simulated and real-life data. We conducted a benchmark analysis of ``ready-to-use'' tools in R comparing 4 model-based (Kamila algorithm, Latent Class Analysis, Latent Class Model [LCM] and Clustering by Mixture Modeling) and 5 distance/dissimilarity-based (Gower distance or Unsupervised Extra Trees dissimilarity followed by hierarchical clustering or Partitioning Around Medoids, K-prototypes) clustering methods. Clustering performances were assessed by Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) on 1000 generated virtual populations consisting of mixed variables using 7 scenarios with varying population sizes, number of clusters, number of continuous and categorical variables, proportions of relevant (non-noisy) variables and degree of variable relevance (low, mild, high). Clustering methods were then applied on the EPHESUS randomized clinical trial data (a heart failure trial evaluating the effect of eplerenone) allowing to illustrate the differences between different clustering techniques. The simulations revealed the dominance of K-prototypes, Kamila and LCM models over all other methods. Overall, methods using dissimilarity matrices in classical algorithms such as Partitioning Around Medoids and Hierarchical Clustering had a lower ARI compared to model-based methods in all scenarios. When applying clustering methods to a real-life clinical dataset, LCM showed promising results with regard to differences in (1) clinical profiles across clusters, (2) prognostic performance (highest C-index) and (3) identification of patient subgroups with substantial treatment benefit. The present findings suggest key differences in clustering performance between the tested algorithms (limited to tools readily available in R). In most of the tested scenarios, model-based methods (in particular the Kamila and LCM packages) and K-prototypes typically performed best in the setting of heterogeneous data.},

@article{Ghaderyan2020,
	abstract = {Gait rhythm fluctuations are of great importance for automatic neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) detection. They provide a cost-effective and noninvasive monitoring tool in which their parameters are related to neuromuscular function. This study investigated a new solution based on a set of new symmetric features and sparse non-negative least squares (NNLS) coding classifier. Dynamic gait series warping (DGSW), Euclidean, Manhattan, Minkowski, Chebyshev, Canberra distances, and cosine function were used to quantify the amount of divergence between the left and right stride, swing, and stance intervals. The algorithm was evaluated using the gait signals of 20 healthy control subjects, 20 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 15 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and 20 patients with Huntington's disease (HD). The proposed new approach using symmetric features and NNLS technique achieved outstanding accuracies of 98%, 97%, and 95% on the patients with PD, ALS, and HD, respectively. The findings also suggested that the new DGSW, cosine function, and Chebyshev distance, which are designed to dynamically, geometrically, or nonlinearly quantify the similarity between two time series, provide the discriminatory measures to describe how NDDs alter the gait symmetry. In comparison with other studies, combining symmetric features with a sparse NNLS coding classifier can improve the detection accuracy providing an efficient and cost-effective framework for the development of a NDDs detection system.},
