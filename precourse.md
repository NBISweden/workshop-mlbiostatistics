### <img border="0" src="icons/precourse.svg" width="40" height="40"> Precourse information


There are few things **to do** before the course starts. These include:

- [Pre-course homework](#homework)
- [Setting-up environment](#R)
- [Setting-up communication](#com)
- [What to bring](#whattobring)

<br/>
#### Pre-course homework <a name="homework"></a>
- Biostatistics and machine learning is based on mathematics so in order to have a good start at the course we need to revise or pick-up the basics.
- Go to [https://nbisweden.github.io/workshop-mlbiostatistics/session-precourse-math/docs](https://nbisweden.github.io/workshop-mlbiostatistics/session-precourse-math/docs/index.html) and have a look at the Mathematical Foundations, 7 chapters covering basics of mathematical notations, sets, functions, differentiation, integration, vectors and matrices.
- Find pen and paper and **write down** the solutions (or your best attempt) to the following exercises:
  - Ex. 1.3: f, g, h
  - Ex. 1.4: e, f, g, h
  - Ex. 2.2
  - Ex. 3.2, 3.3
  - Ex. 4.6: h, i, j
  - Ex. 5.1: i, j
  - Ex. 6.1: e
  - Ex. 7.1: h

<br/>
#### R, R-Studio and R Markdown <a name="R"></a>
During the course we will be using `R` programming language within `RStudio Desktop` editor. We will be writing scripts using `R Markdown` (.Rmd). We will try to keep coding as simple as possible, but we do assume that you have a basic understanding of R and your computer setup with RStudio and R version 3.5.0 or higher.  

R skills that will be useful during the course are:

- using R as calculator incl. raising values to a power
- being able to work with vectors and matrices, incl. subsetting and matrices multiplication
- reading in data from .csv files, e.g. with `read.delim()`
- printing top few rows or last few rows, e.g. with `head()` and `tail()`
- using in-built summary functions such as `sum()`, `min()` or `max()`
- being able to use documentation pages for R functions, e.g. with `help()` or `?()`
- using if else statements, writing simple loops and functions.
- making simple scatter plots of one numerical variable against another, both with `plot()` and `ggplot()`
- being able to install CRAN packages e.g. with `install.packages()`
- being familiar with R Markdown format

Some useful links on installation are under [precourse-R](precourse-R/precourse-R).


<br/>
#### Setting up communication <a name="com"></a>
- Check the Canvas website for event-specific details.

<br/>
#### What to bring (have) <a name="whattobring"></a>
- a laptop with R and R-Studio installations (see below)
- solutions (or attempts) to the exercises (see above precourse homework)
- a working web camera and a quiet space to take the course from (if online)
